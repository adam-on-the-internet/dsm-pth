## October 18, 2021 - Present

The City of Des Moines refuses to make their Procedural Rules for Council Meetings public, so we have transcribed a copy of the rules we obtained and added some additional information.

The transcription was taken from a less-friendly PDF document (provided by the City Clerk in November 2021).

The Procedural Rules for city meetings are adopted and amended through Resolution action.

# DSM City Code
