<h2 id="appendix-b-attachment-electronic-meetings">Appendix B - Attachment: Electronic Meetings</h2>
<h3 id="may-21-1986">May 21, 1986</h3>
<p>WHEREAS, electronic participation by absent City Council
  members fully comports with the policy considerations underlying
  Chapter 21 of the Iowa Code, the Iowa Legislature&#39;s Open Meetings
  Law, the purpose of which is to assure that the City&#39;s decision
  making occurs in public session to which all members of the public
  are afforded participatory access to the extent reasonably
  possible; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS, there are many issues where because of the statutory
  voting requirements, or the importance of the subject matter to
  the public, it is necessary or desirable to arrange for
  participation of as many of the council members as possible even
  through a majority but not all members can be physically present
  at the meeting; NOW, THEREFORE,</p>
<p>BE IT RESOLVED, by the City Council of the City of Des Moines,
  Iowa:</p>
<p>That it shall be the local rule of this City Council to secure
  electronic participation by absent members whenever it is
  physically feasible where such participation is necessary or
  desirable because of statutory voting requirements or the
  importance of the subject matter to the public.</p>
<p>Moved by Szymoniak to adopt.</p>
<p>FORM APPROVED:</p>
<p>Nelda Barrow Mickle</p>
<p>Acting Corporation Counsel</p>
