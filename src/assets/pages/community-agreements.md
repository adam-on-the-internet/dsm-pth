# Community Agreements

- Last Updated 1/26/22

## 1. Reach an Agreement

At the start of any People’s Town Hall event, we will go through the agreement and be open to feedback, questions, and potential changes.

## 2. Step Up, Step Back

Everyone is invited to speak and we want everyone to have an opportunity, say what’s on your heart, and then step back so that others can speak too.

## 3. One Speaker, One Mic

To the best of our ability, let’s honor the courage it takes to speak in public by listening.

## 4. You Matter

Every person’s perspective matters because crafting the solutions our community needs will take each of us and our unique perspectives and experiences.

## 5. Hate Speech 

At the root of community is love and we won’t tolerate any less. Racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, and any other “isms” are not allowed.

## 6. We Grow Together

When we work to better understand our community, we can build the future we need together.

## 7. Safety through Communication

If someone at our events is creating a hostile or unsafe space, let someone working the event know so we can work to resolve the situation.

We cannot guarantee safety but believe that through compassion and communication we can do our best to address unsafe situations.

This may be the case if a known abuser is present, if someone is threatening people, or otherwise creating a hostile or unsafe space.
