# Pronoun Intro

## Modelling

Hello, everyone! 
My name is ______. 
My pronouns are ______.

For example, 
if someone was talking about someone with she/her pronouns, they might say 
"she is leading the meeting", 
or someone might say about someone with he/him pronouns,
"he is facilitating discussion", 
or when talking about someone who uses they/them pronouns, you can say 
"they shared this idea during discussion".

## Disclaimer

We do not always need to justify our pronouns, 
but in meetings where we are welcoming new people
we want to extend grace to folks who may be unfamiliar with stating pronouns
to work toward an understanding and
make sure we aren't leaving anyone out,
and to let everyone know where we are coming from.

## Explanation

We make a point to share our pronouns
because understanding and using people’s correct gender pronouns helps ensure an 
inclusive culture where all voices are given equitable power. 

We’re here to build a multi-racial, multi-gendered, multi-generational, multi-geographical movement for justice, 
and sharing our pronouns is one way to model that inclusivity.

You do not have to share your pronouns if you're not comfortable or would prefer not to for any other reasons.
