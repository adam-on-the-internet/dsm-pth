# Accessibility Issues with Des Moines City Meetings

- last updated 7/12/22

## 1. City Council meetings do not have virtual or hybrid options for participation

- People can't call in to participate with statements during the public comment periods 
- The City has had over a year to offer a virtual participation option
- This is a barrier to access for:
	- Immunocompromised people
	- People who are sick or have been recently exposed to COVID or other illnesses
	- People with children who cannot afford babysitters 
	- People without transportation to City Hall

## 2. City Hall is not accessible
	
- All 4 sides of the building should have signage to show where the disabled entrances are
    - Lack of signage causes anxiety
    - The disabled entrance is treated differently than the other entrances, people have been stuck in the lobby waiting to be let through to the rest of the building.
- City Hall is very hard to navigate with a wheelchair
- In Council Chambers, there is no dedicated room for wheelchair users or for people to put their mobility aids (walkers / crutches) during the meeting
- Masks are not required
	- The City should offer & require N95 or other high-quality masks
    - This puts people in danger of an airborne virus that kills and disables folks (1 in 5 people can get severe LongCovid, and this jumps to a higher probability if one is reinfected again and again.)
- Access to the elevators takes a city staff escort
    - The elevators are behind chained barriers and it is embarassing to have to ask security to be escorted
- The way chairs are set up in the room leaves no spaces for wheelchairs (we'd have to ask for help to get chairs reshuffled, and that shouldn't be needed. The space should just be open regardless). 
- Terrible ventilation within the building. This needs updated and more air filtration devices installed.
- The City's official policy is that accessibility requests should be made 72 hours before a meeting, but they frequently put out agendas 24 hours before meetings and do not accomodate the requests they receive
- Parking by City Hall is not accessible
    - Disabled Parking was not clearly indicated, its hard to tell where to park 
    - parking is not free, and meters have a max time that can exceed meeting time    

## 3. The City (usually the City Clerk) cuts speaker's mics randomly 

- This makes it near impossible to hear anything on the stream. 
- There isn't a clear pattern to the mic cutoffs - some folks they gave the full time to and others not, it is a clear double standard and appears retaliatory
- Former City Clerk frequently muted and banned people from virtual city meetings in 2020
    - This was especially targetted at Black folks and people with foreign-sounding names from virtual city meetings.

## 4. Communication issues

- No transcripts are provided to the public
- Meeting minutes are inaccurate and have incorrect council votes on them
- Captions are wrong and often just non-existent. 
- Translations are not provided
- No sign language or ASL interpreter provided
- City officials frequently speak off mic and have side conversations during public meetings
    - These comments are kept off the public record and are inaudible to most people watching the meeting

## 5. Breaking open meeting & records laws

- Open meeting laws provide a (limited) amount of accessibility. 
- When the City fails to follow these laws, members of the public are unable to make necessary plans
- The City fails this by not announcing all meetings, covering matters that are not listed on official City Agendas, refusing to provide public documents, not announcing votes during meetings, and more (many other items here are against open meetings & records laws) 

## 6. Issues with the City's Rules & Conduct
	
- Arbitrarily bringing the SWAT/STAR team to City Meetings, who have been used to arrest residents & block residents from participating by holding the council chamber doors closed
- No food/drink (including water!)
- The short 2-minute speaking limit is enforced arbitrarily
- The rules to speak are overly confusing and changed between meeting to meeting
- Other building rules (such as council chamber attendance limit & what items are banned from City Hall, like food and posters) are not announced before meetings or otherwise made public
- city has passed various rules directly limiting public participation aimed at racial justice protestors
