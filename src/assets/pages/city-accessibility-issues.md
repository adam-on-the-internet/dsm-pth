# Accessibility Issues with Des Moines City Meetings

- last updated 7/12/22

## 1. City Council meetings do not have virtual or hybrid options for participation. 

- People can't call in and participate with statements during the public statement period. 
- The City has had over a year to offer virtual participation
- This is a barrier to access for:
	- Immunocomprimised people
	- People who are sick or have been recently exposed to COVID or other illnesses
	- Others, such as folks with children who cannot afford babysitters or do not have transportation to City Hall

## 2. City Hall is not accessible
	
- City Hall is very hard to navigate with a wheelchair. 
- Not Requiring N95 or better masks. This puts people in danger of an airborne virus that kills and disables folks (1 in 5 people can get severe LongCovid, and this jumps to a higher probability if one is reinfected again and again.)
	- also not providing masks, they used to
- Access to the elevators takes a city staff escort
- The way chairs are set up in the room leaves no spaces for wheelchairs (we'd have to ask for help to get chairs reshuffled, and that shouldn't be needed. The space should just be open regardless). 
- Terrible ventilation within the building. This needs updated and more air filtration devices installed.
- The City's official policy is that accessibility requests should be made 72 hours before a meeting, but they frequently put out agendas 24 hours before meetings and do not accomodate the requests they receive
- Parking by City Hall is not free

## 3. The City (usually the City Clerk) cuts people's mics randomly 

- which makes it near impossible to hear anything on the stream. 
- (there isn't a clear pattern to the mic cutoffs - some folks they gave the full time to and others not, it is a clear double standard and seems retaliatory)
- City officials frequently speak off mic and have side conversations during public meetings
- Former City Clerk frequently muted and banned Black folks and people with foreign-sounding names from virtual city meetings.

## 4. Communication issues

- No transcripts are provided to the public
- Meeting minutes are inaccurate and have incorrect council votes on them
- Captions are terrible and often non-existent. 
- Translations are not provided
- No sign language or ASL interpreter provided

## 5. Breaking open meeting & records laws

- Open meeting laws provide a (limited) amount of accessibility. 
- When the City fails to follow these laws, members of the public are unable to make necessary plans
- The City fails this by not announcing all meetings, covering matters that are not listed on official City Agendas, refusing to provide public documents, not announcing votes during meetings, and more (many other items here are against open meetings & records laws) 

## 6. Issues with the City's Rules & Conduct
	
- Arbitrarily bringing the SWAT/STAR team to City Meetings, who have been used to arrest residents & block residents from participating by holding the council chamber doors closed
- No food/drink (including water!)
- The short 2-minute speaking limit is enforced arbitrarily
- The rules to speak are overly confusing and changed between meeting to meeting
- Other building rules (such as council chamber attendance limit & what items are banned from City Hall, like food and posters) are not announced before meetings or otherwise made public
- city has passed various rules directly limiting public participation aimed at racial justice protestors
