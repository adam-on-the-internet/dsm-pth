### Meeting Process

- Presiding Officer (Mayor, or Mayor Pro Tem if Mayor is absent) starts the meeting
    - They sometimes include Proclamations or other general comments. If so, they usually happen before the official start at 5:00pm.
- The meeting is then introduced with general items like Roll Call and Approving the Agenda
    - Council members may pull items from the Consent Item at this time. Items not pulled are voted on in bulk.
- The meeting then goes to the Hearing Section. These items allow public comment and are usually discussed in order.
    - These are typically the ONLY items where the public can comment, except for Public Reports
- The meeting then goes back to any "Consent Agenda" items that got pulled from the Consent Agenda for further discussion.
- The meeting then proceeds with all agenda items in order.
- The meeting concludes with "Public Reports", general public comments from the Sign-Up to Speak.

### Meeting Logistics

- Meetings are typically held at City Hall in Council Chambers on the second floor and stream on YouTube and DMTV. They are also typically recorded and posted afterwards. 
    - Although they stream and City Council Members can participate virtually, as of 6/26/22 there is no virtual option for the public.
- At City Hall, there is a security checkpoint with a metal detector. Bags are checked and many items (including food and water bottles) are not allowed.
- City Staff typically hands out physical copies of the Agenda outside Council Chambers
- There is a capacity limit to the Council Chambers. Once this limit is reached, any additional members of the public are left in the Great Hall outside council chambers.
    - City Staff is tasked with helping people in this overflow section enter the Council Chambers to speak when appropriate
- Anyone who cannot take stairs to the second floor council chambers must request access to the building's elevator
