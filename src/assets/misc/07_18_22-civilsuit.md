## What's Happening

content warning for police violence

Two DMPD officers, Peter Wilson and Jeffrey George, 
recently filed civil lawsuits against 6 protestors from July 1, 2020.

On July 1, DMPD and the Iowa State Patrol claimed they had warrants, and then proceeded to 
unlawfully detain and attack protestors at the Iowa Capitol. 

This resulted in "capitol bans", where several protestors were then banned from their state capitol. 
These bans were unconstitutional and overturned by the courts.

## The City is Responsible

While this civil suit is brought by two individual cops, not the city proper, the city is still responsible

- The cops are city employees and were working for the city at the time in question
- The cops are using City resources, through their jobs, to bring these suits forward
- The cops can only do this because they have reason to believe the city will protect them 
    - That's because of the city and council's inability to criticize the DMPD and the city's silencing of DMPD critics
    - The city is still fighting lawsuits from other protestors who were abused by DMPD during 2020.
- These cops are managed by Chief Dana Wingert, who is managed by City Manager Scott Sanders, who is managed by the Council

## What is Admitted

In this filing, the cops claim in writing that they feel racial justice protestors are "domestic terrorists"

- We are not safe when our police force refers to residents this way, as enemy combatants.
- The department cannot feasibily claim to offer "public safety" to people it views this way.
- A lot of us knew DMPD considers protestors "terrorists", but now its actually admitted in a court filing.
- At a minimum, the DMPD should fire these two officers and any others who believe protestors are "terrorists"
- The City often allocates lots of money for "anti-terrorism" projects, in Des Moines and further out in Iowa.
- Myself and others have opposed these projects because we know who DMPD means when they say "terrorists", and its a lot of residents of Des Moines, especially Black folks.
- The City terminated a private security contract with Conley in part because their CEO communicated with Chief Wingert calling protestors terrorists
	- Wingert faced no discipline for this
	- It appears our standard for private security is higher than our standard for Police Officers
	
## Conclusion

DMPD abuses their power, and the most direct way to take some of that power away from them is by taking some funding away and moving it to community programs that would prevent violence and harm

- We need to Defund DMPD, Fire Sanders, and Fire Wingert
