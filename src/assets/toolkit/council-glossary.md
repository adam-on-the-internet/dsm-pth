# Council Glossary

**Closed Session:** Closed Session meetings are not open to the public
but they are still listed publicly. 
Council is allowed to hold these meetings for sensitive topics like
ongoing negotations & lawsuits.

**City Code:** City Code is modified through ordinances.

**Council Communications:** Council Communications are agenda 
attachments that give general information about agenda items, usually written
in regular casual language (compared to resolutions).

**Consent Agenda:** Consent Agendas are parts of Council Agendas that is voted on all at once.
The agenda is supposed to be for routine, noncontroversial items but council constantly puts
controversial items on this agenda.
Council acts inconsistently on these items, but currently the official way to get items pulled
is to request an item be pulled by emailing the City Clerk before 3pm on the day of the meeting. 

**Hearings:** Hearings are the only part of council meetings where Council must allow Public Comment.

**Housing Board:** The Housing Board is a secondary function of Council, which usually holds meetings
directly before Regular Meetings.

discusses (with city staff) what is going on in the State of Iowa's legislative session.
Council considers lobbying opportunities and legislation that would affect the city.

**Ordinance:** Council passes Ordinances to alter City Code. Ordinances regularly 
require 3 readings, but may have the 2nd and 3rd readings waived in some circumstances.

**Presiding Officer:** The Presiding Officer runs Council Meetings. The Mayor is typically
the Presiding Officer.

**Procedural Rules:** The Council has Procedural Rules that outline how their meetings are meant to function.
These rules are amended through simple Resolutions, unlike City Code which requires Ordinances.

**Quarterly Work Session:** Council holds Quarterly Work Sessions, which are a day long and cover a 
long list of topics.

**Regular Meeting:** Council holds Regular Meetings once or twice a month at City Hall at 5pm.

**Resolution:** Resolutions are passed by Council at meetings. These Resolutions are attached to the Council Agendas,
and are typically more complicated (legal) language, compared to Communications which are written more plainly.

**Work Session:** City Council holds Work Sessions to discuss various topics the City is managing. These meetings are Public but there is no public input allowed. They are streamed on YouTube, recorded, and posted to YouTube after they end. The majority of the topics are presentations by City Staff or other people.

**Setting Date of Hearing:** Council sets the dates for Hearings before the meetings where the Hearing happens.
These items are usually on the Consent Agenda, and are frequently mistaken for immediate action.
