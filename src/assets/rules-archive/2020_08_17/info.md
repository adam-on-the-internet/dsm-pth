# V12: First Major Public Speaking Restrictions

August 17, 2020 - May 10, 2021 

## Summary

The rule amendment did not include a list of changes, instead council approved the amendments as 
an entire new draft of rules.

This came shortly after the first major BLM turnout at a (virtual) City Council Meeting. 
At that meeting, Council discussed ~$100,000 in ammunition DMPD. Public commentors protested and council shut down the virtual meeting 
to silence the people who spoke up. Council then held a separate meeting a different day to continue the discussion, 
where the public successfully fillibustered the meeting for around 12 hours. 

The city did not document which rules they changed, so we are missing a lot of the change information.

Council amended Rule 16. Citizen Agenda Requests.

Council amended Rule 28. Manner of Addressing Council.

Council amended Rule 29. Time Limit on Citizen's Remarks.

Council amended Rule 30. Remarks of Citizens to be Germane.
