the Council meeting.

**If the item is requested by a Council Member, it shall be approved by the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tem
prior to inclusion on the Agenda. If either the Mayor or Mayor Pro Tem are the requesting
Council Member, approval by the other for inclusion on the Agenda shall be sufficient for the purposes

again declined by the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tem, the item shall be placed on the Agenda to be considered
by the full council for inclusion at the next Council Workshop or other disposition as directed by Council.**
