# V11: Waiver for Ordinance Readings

September 23, 2013 - August 17, 2020 

## Summary

The City amended **Rule 42A. Waiver of Ordinance Readings** 
regarding how council may pass an ordinance with a single reading
(skipping the routine second and third readings).

This was done
"to more precisely align with the Iowa Code and the practices of the City Council 
with respect to consideration and passage of City ordinances", 
seemingly to fix an earlier mistake from past amendments.
