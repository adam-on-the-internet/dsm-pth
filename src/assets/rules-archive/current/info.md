# Current Procedural Rules

## As of October 18, 2021

The City of Des Moines refuses to make their City Council Procedural Rules public, so we have transcribed a copy of the rules we obtained and added some additional information.

The transcription was taken from a less-friendly PDF document 
(obtained through a FOIA request in November 2021).

The Procedural Rules for city meetings are adopted and amended through Resolution action.

## DSM City Code

City Code is modified through Ordinances. City Code Section 2.70 applies to meetings as well. 
The City Code is publicly available, and also contains text about the City's legal ability to cite alleged rule-breakers.
