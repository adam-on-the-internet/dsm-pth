Except as
specifically required by these rules the Council shall not use any
formal points of parliamentary order, personal privilege,
parliamentary inquiry or other technical forms.

### Rule 3. Matters Not Covered

Any matter or order or
procedure not covered by these rules shall be referred to the
presiding officer, who shall decide the matter with the assistance
and advice of Corporation Counsel or his or her representative in
conformity with the purpose of these rules in a fair and
expeditious manner. The decision of the presiding officer may be
reversed by a majority vote of the Council.

### Rule 4. Interpretation

These rules are intended to
supplement and shall be interpreted to conform with the statutes
of the State of Iowa and the ordinances of the City of Des Moines.

## Part II. Time and Place of Meeting

### Rule 5. Regular Meetings

The City Clerk shall prepare an annual schedule of Council meetings
and forward it to the City Council, to adopt by resolution,
at least 60 days prior to January 1 of each year.
Regular meetings will begin at 5:00 P.M. in City Council Chambers.
The Council may, by resolution or motion, continue or postpone any regular meeting
to another day and time, or may cancel a meeting.
All regular meetings shall end by 9:00 P.M unless the Council
by a 2/3 vote agrees that the meeting may continue.
All hearings shall be scheduled for 5:00 P.M.
the day of a regular meeting and shall commence promptly
at the conclusion of the Consent Agenda and prior to consideration
of any item removed from the Consent Agenda or any other Agenda item
unless the presiding officer or the Council otherwise directs.

### Rule 6. Special Meetings

Special meetings may be called by the Mayor or by any four Council Members.
A call for special meeting shall be filed with the City Clerk in written form
unless the announcement of the special meeting is made at a regular meeting
at which all Council members are present.
The call for the special meeting shall specify the day, hour and subject
of the meeting and shall be posted at the door of the City Council Chambers.

### Rule 7. Quorum

A majority of all members elected to the City Council
shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business.

## Part III. Agenda

### Rule 8. Preparation of Agenda

Prior to each regular Council meeting the City Clerk shall
publish an Agenda which contains all items the Council anticipates
acting upon at the meeting.
The Council may adopt the agenda as presented, or may amend the
agenda as provided by these rules and may adopt the agenda as amended.

### Rule 9. Consent Agenda

In preparing an Agenda the City Clerk shall separately designate items
as "Consent Agenda" which may be acted upon by the Council under Rule 37.
The "Consent Agenda" shall consist of routine non-controversial items
which in the City Clerk's determination can be appropriately considered in
bulk at the Council meeting.

### Rule 10. Hearings, Permits and License Agenda

The Clerk shall prepare as separate portions of the Agenda a schedule of
hearings and separate listing of requests for Permits and Licenses.

### Rule 11. Agenda Deadline

Any member of the Council, the City Manager, Corporation Counsel
and City Clerk may have an item included upon the Agenda by requesting
the City Clerk to include the item by 5:00 P.M. on the Wednesday preceding
the Council meeting.

If the item is requested by a Council Member, it shall be approved by the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tem
prior to inclusion on the Agenda. If either the Mayor or Mayor Pro Tem are the requesting
Council Member, approval by the other for inclusion on the Agenda shall be sufficient for the purposes
of this rule. If the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tem decline to include the requested item at the
meeting at which it is first requested, then after that meeting occurs, the requesting Council Member may 
make a second request for inclusion on the Agenda for the next regular meeting. If the item is 
again declined by the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tem, the item shall be placed on the Agenda to be considered
by the full council for inclusion at the next Council Workshop or other disposition as directed by Council.

### Rule 12. Extra Items

Items requested or filed after 5:00
P.M. on the Wednesday preceding a Council meeting shall not be
included upon the Agenda unless a Council Member shall deem the
item of sufficient urgency to warrant immediate Council action.
These items shall be designated as "Extra" items and will be
considered at the appropriate place on the regular Agenda (prior
to or after a related item) or at the end of the regular Agenda.
The requirements of Rule 11 shall also apply to Extra Items requests.
The City Clerk shall record on the item the name of the sponsoring
Council member.

### Rule 13. Sponsor Required

The City Clerk shall not place
upon the Agenda any matter for reconsideration unless sponsored by
a Council member who voted on the originally prevailing side or
who was absent at the time of the original action.

### Rule 14. Staff Withdrawal of Items

Only the City officer
requesting the placement of an item on the Agenda may withdraw the
item prior to the Council meeting, but in withdrawing the item
shall state the reason therefore which reason shall be transmitted
to the Council. An item withdrawn by the City Manager, City Clerk
or Corporation Counsel may nonetheless, in the discretion of the
Council, be acted upon in its regular order.

### Rule 15. Council Action to Defer, Continue or Not Act

A member of the City Council shall not withdraw any item prior to
the start of Council meetings, provided however, a Council member
wishing Council to defer action or continue an item has a right to
have a motion to continue, defer or not act on any item considered
before any other action which Council may consider.

### Rule 16. Citizen Agenda Requests

Any citizen may request
to have an item placed on the Agenda (including a request to speak)
by filing such request in writing with the City Clerk
on or after the date ten days preceding a regular Council meeting but
prior to
5:00 P.M. on the 
Tuesday preceding a regular Council meeting. 
All such requests,
up to a maximum of twenty items,
shall be placed under a single item 
number, but last
on the agenda,
by lettered paragraph and limited collectively to no more than
forty minutes
in duration. 

Each item shall receive up to two minutes
time and shall not be recalculated or additional speakers
recognized if the time used by any speaker is less than two minutes
or the collective time for all speakers is less than forty-minutes.

No other person may speak on any such item. Any requested item not included
on the agenda due to the collective time limit and maximum number of items
specified herein being exceeded, shall, subject to such time limit and maximum number
of items applied to each Agenda for a subsequent regular meeting, move in the same order
received by the City Clerk to the Agenda for the next regular meeting or, as necessary, 
the Agenda for the next subsequent
meeting(s), with any new timely requests added to the end of the list of pending Citizen's 
Agenda items in the order received.

Any person may have no more than one Agenda item request pending at a time and the City Clerk 
shall not accept a new request from a person that has a request pending.

## Part IV. Conduct of Meetings

### Rule 17. Roll Call

Before proceeding with the business of
the Council, the City Clerk shall call the roll call of members
present, and enter those named in the minutes.
The Clerk shall determine the presence of a quorum as required by
law and these rules.

### Rule 18. Call to Order

The Mayor or Mayor Pro Tem shall call the meeting to order at the appointed hour.
In the absence of the Mayor or Mayor Pro Tem the City Clerk
shall call the meeting to order and a temporary presiding officer shall
then be selected under Rule 19.
The selected temporary presiding officer shall serve as
successor Mayor Pro Tem for the meeting for purposes of
Des Moines City Code Section 2-26 authorized to sign all measures passed
and contracts approved at the meeting.

### Rule 19. Presiding Officer

The Mayor, or in the Mayor's
absence or incapacity, the Mayor Pro Tem, shall be the presiding
officer at all Council meetings.
If both the Mayor and Mayor Pro
Tem are absent the most senior Council member present shall
preside. In the event two or more members equally possess the
greatest seniority then the eldest person among them shall preside.

### Rule 20. Control of Discussion

The presiding officer shall
control discussion of the Council on each Agenda item to assure
full participation by the Council in accordance with these rules.

### Rule 21. Order of Consideration of Agenda

Except as
otherwise provided in these rules, each Agenda item shall be
considered in the numerical order assigned by the City Clerk.
Each Agenda item shall be separately announced by the
presiding officer, or City Clerk, for purposes of discussion and consideration.
To announce an item it shall be sufficient to identify the item by
the number assigned by the City Clerk,
unless greater specificity is requested by some person in
attendance.
This rule shall not
apply to consideration of items under Rule 37 or Rule 38.

### Rule 22. Discussion

A Council member shall speak only after being recognized by the presiding officer.
A Council member recognized for a specific purpose shall limit remarks to that purpose.
A Council member, after being recognized shall not be interrupted except
by the presiding officer to enforce these rules.

### Rule 23. Presiding Officer's Right to Enter into Discussion

The Mayor (or other presiding officer) as a member
of the Council may enter into any discussion.

### Rule 24. Limit on Remarks

Each Council member shall limit his or her remarks to a reasonable length.

### Rule 25. Presiding Officer's Right to Speak Last

The presiding officer has the right to close debate and speak last on
any item.

### Rule 26. Closing Debate

Discussion shall be closed on any
item by the presiding officer with the concurrence of a majority
of the Council. Except as provided by Rule 35, a call for the
vote shall not close discussion if any member of the Council still
wishes to be heard or the presiding officer determines the
continued participation of citizens will be helpful to the Council.

## Part V. Citizen Participation

### Rule 27. Citizen's Right to Address Council

Persons other than Council Members shall be permitted to address the
Council only upon specific Agenda items.

### Rule 28. Manner of Addressing Council

At each regular 
Council meeting, if any requests to speak have been received, a 
person desiring to address the Council shall step to the podium, 
state one’s address, and group affiliation (if any) and speak 
clearly into the microphone.  In lieu of providing a current 
residential address at the time of speaking during any non-public
hearing item at the meeting, a person may provide one’s 
address via email, written mail, or other writing to the City 
Clerk on or after the date ten days preceding the meeting but 
prior to 3:00 P.M. on the day of the meeting at which the 
requester desires to speak.

If the person has provided a 
current address to the City Clerk as required herein and the 
City Clerk has verified this address, then the person desiring 
to speak shall only be required to provide one’s name, zip code 
and ward residency at the time of speaking. At all public 
hearings, however, each speaker at each hearing that is a party 
in interest shall be required to provide one’s name, address, 
and group affiliation (if any).

All other speakers may, if an 
address previously was provided to the City Clerk, only be 
required to provide one’ name, zip code and ward residency at 
the time of speaking.  If the meeting is entirely electronic, 
the person shall use the prescribed method for comments, but 
shall not speak on the same item more than once.  If the meeting 
is not entirely electronic, then only those persons in 
attendance at the physical location of the meeting will be 
permitted to speak and only in accordance with these rules and 
the City Code.  The person shall follow these rules and the 
direction of the presiding officer at all times.

### Rule 29. Time Limit on Citizen's Remarks

Citizens shall be limited to no more than five minutes
speaking time per Agenda item
on which the public is allowed to speak, unless additional or less
time is determined by the presiding officer. 
Total citizen in-put on any subject under Council consideration can be further
limited to a fixed period by the presiding officer.
A majority vote of the Council may alter the time limitations of this rule.

### Rule 30. Remarks of Citizens to be Germane

Citizen comments must be directed to the subject under consideration.
The presiding officer shall rule on the germaneness of citizen comments.
Citizens making personal, repetitive, slanderous or disruptive
remarks or engaging in any action that otherwise impedes the
orderly conduct of a council meeting shall not be recognized by
the presiding officer
during the remainder of the meeting. 

To ensure the meeting is conducted orderly and free from interference
or interruption, the presiding officer is vested with exclusive discretion to
review and determine whether remarks or actions meet any prohibited terms
of this rule. Without limitation, arguing with the presiding officer about
any determination will be considered per se disruptive.

Persons who make or attempt
to make non-germane remarks
during any portion of the meeting
shall not be
recognized by the presiding officer during the remainder of the
meeting.

### Rule 31. Matters Not on the Agenda

The Council may in its
discretion allow citizens who wish to raise a matter not on the
Agenda and who have not filed a request under Rule 16 to
address the Council at the end of the regular Agenda.

### Rule 31A. Failure to Follow Council Rules

To enable the Council to transact the business of the City
and conduct efficient meetings, persons other than Council members
who fail to follow the direction of the presiding officer
on more than one occasion during a Council meeting shall not be recognized
by the presiding officer during the remainder of the meeting.

## Part VI. Council Action

### Rule 32. Motion Required

All action requiring a vote shall be moved by a member of the Council.

### Rule 33. Motion to Reconsider

A motion to reconsider must be made by a Council member
who was on the prevailing side in the original action
or by a Council Member absent at the time of the original action.
The sponsoring of the reconsideration of a matter by the Mayor,
or other presiding officer, has the effect of a motion to reconsider.

### Rule 33A.

Rule 33 of these Rules notwithstanding, when less
than seven members of the Council are in attendance at a meeting
and an Agenda Item fails to receive four affirmative or negative
votes then the Agenda Item shall, upon the request of any Council
member in attendance at the meeting, be placed by the Clerk on the
Agenda for the next Council meeting, and continued thereafter upon
the Agenda for subsequent meetings until it shall receive four
affirmative or negative votes.
In the event an Item continued under this rule is consideration of
an ordinance, the ordinance shall not be considered to have been
read or considered for its first or any subsequent passage
unless it shall receive four affirmative votes.

### Rule 34. No Motions by Presiding Officer

DELETED by City
Council Roll Call 99-525 of February 22, 1999.

### Rule 35. Call for Vote

At the conclusion of debate the
presiding officer shall call for a vote, provided however, a
majority of the Council may require a vote at any time.

### Rule 36. Separate Consideration

Except as otherwise
required by these rules each Agenda item shall be voted upon
separately by electronic means and each separate vote shall be
recorded by the City Clerk.

### Rule 37. Action on Consent Agenda

Except as herein provided
the "Consent Agenda" shall be considered in bulk and voted upon in
single motion. Each Council Member shall separately note upon a
form provided by the City Clerk any matter on the "Consent Agenda"
upon which he or she wishes to speak or to vote no. At the time
of consideration of the "Consent Agenda" the presiding officer
shall announce the items upon which Council members have indicated
they wish to speak or vote no. Members of the public may request
via email, written mail or other writing to the City Clerk to
remove any single item by 3:00 p.m. on the day of the Council
meeting, which Council may remove upon majority vote, but no oral
requests may be made at the meeting. Any items upon which any
Council Member wishes to speak, or items upon which a citizen
wishes to speak which have been removed from the consent agenda by
majority vote, shall be considered separately and not as a portion
of any motion calling for action upon the remainder of the "Consent
Agenda". The City Clerk, on all matters contained in the "Consent
Agenda" shall record the yes and no votes on each item separately
as if each item had been moved and voted upon separately. Rule 21
shall not apply.

### Rule 38. Action to Multiple Items

With the consent of a majority of the Council,
Rule 36 hereof notwithstanding,
the Council may consider for voting purposes more than one item,
but in such event the vote upon each item will be separately
recorded by the City Clerk noting specific yes or no votes of
each Council member on each item.

### Rule 39. Consideration Out of Order

With the consent of
the Council any Agenda item may be considered out of order at
the request of a Council member.

### Rule 40. Recording Names of Moving Members

The City Clerk shall record the name of the Council Member making each
motion.

### Rule 41. Consideration of Matters Not on Agenda

consideration by the Council any member of the Council may,

as permitted by law or direct such matter be included upon a later Agenda.

## Part VII. Miscellaneous

### Rule 42. Motions

any member of the Council may make a motion for the Council to
act upon any matter if the motion is germane to the matter under
consideration.

Any member of the Council may make a motion to recess or adjourn the meeting at any time during the meeting for any reason.

### Rule 42A. Waiver of Ordinance Readings

A Council member may move the final passage of an ordinance,
with waiver and suspension of the requirement that an ordinance
must be considered and voted on for passage at two Council meetings
prior to the meeting at which it is to be finally passed,
by reciting the following motion:

"Moved by (insert the moving Council member's name)
that the rule requiring that an ordinance must be considered
and voted on for passage at two Council meetings prior
to the meeting at which it is to be finally passed be
suspended, that the ordinance be placed upon its final
passage and that the ordinance do now pass."

or may move waiver and suspension by reference to the language of
this section to be known as "the waiver rule".

### Rule 43. Applicability of Rules

These rules shall apply to
the Council when meeting in any form including such times as it
acts as the Municipal Housing Agency Governing Board.

### Rule 44. Name of Sponsor on Roll Call

require an action to be sponsored by a Council member the City
Clerk shall note the name of the sponsoring Council member on the
face of the roll call for said item.

### Rule 45. Suspension of Rules

hereof, may be suspended for a specific purpose by a two-thirds
majority of the Council.

proceedings required for a special purpose, 
a hearing shall commence when declared open by the presiding officer and
shall close when closed by the presiding officer or by other formal
action of the Council.
Any member of the public who fails to follow these rules during any 
hearing process shall not be recognized by the presiding officer 
during the remainder of the meeting.

### Rule 47. Informal Requests

or during the consideration of any matter, or in the course of a
hearing, may request and receive information, explanations or the
opinions of the City Manager, Corporation Counsel, City Clerk or
any City employee.

## Appendix B - Attachment: Electronic Meetings

### May 21, 1986

WHEREAS, electronic participation by absent City Council
members fully comports with the policy considerations underlying
Chapter 21 of the Iowa Code, the Iowa Legislature's Open Meetings
Law, the purpose of which is to assure that the City's decision
making occurs in public session to which all members of the public
are afforded participatory access to the extent reasonably
possible; and

WHEREAS, there are many issues where because of the statutory
voting requirements, or the importance of the subject matter to
the public, it is necessary or desirable to arrange for
participation of as many of the council members as possible even
through a majority but not all members can be physically present
at the meeting; NOW, THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED, by the City Council of the City of Des Moines,
Iowa:

That it shall be the local rule of this City Council to secure
electronic participation by absent members whenever it is
physically feasible where such participation is necessary or
desirable because of statutory voting requirements or the
importance of the subject matter to the public.

Moved by Szymoniak to adopt.

FORM APPROVED:

Nelda Barrow Mickle

Acting Corporation Counsel

## Appendix C - City Code Section 2-70: Meetings

Des Moines City Code is available at [municode](https://library.municode.com/ia/des_moines/codes/code_of_ordinances).

The City Code is separate from the Procedural Rules. The Procedural Rules are adopted and amended through Resolution action. City Code is modified through Ordinances.

### (a) Time, procedure.

Regular meetings of the council shall be held on the dates set forth in a schedule of meetings adopted by the council, at a time to be set by the council. Special meetings may be called from time to time by the mayor or a majority of the members of the council. Notice of the meeting shall be given personally or left at the usual place of residence of each member of the council, and a record of the service of notice shall be made by the clerk. All meetings of the council, whether regular or special, shall be held in accordance with the state public meetings law, I.C. § 21.1 et seq., or other appropriate provision of state law. If, at any meeting, the presiding officer of the council is not present, the mayor pro tem shall act as the presiding officer pro tempore of the meeting, and the mayor pro tem's acts shall have the same force and legality as though performed by the regularly elected presiding officer of the council. In the absence of both, the council shall select a presiding officer for the meeting.

### (b) Holidays. 

When any legal holiday shall fall on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, the regular meeting of the council shall be held at such time and place as may be designated by resolution of the council.

The following rules are adopted for the conduct of those attending regular and special meetings of the city council in the council chamber in the city hall:

#### (3)

No person shall enter the raised area at the east end of the council chamber except representatives or employees of the communications media.

#### (4)

Any person desiring to address the council may do so when recognized by the presiding officer, but the council reserves the right to limit the speaker's time and the order in which the speakers may address the council.

#### (5)

No person shall be interrupted while addressing the council except by a member of the council.

#### (6)

No member of the public shall be permitted to sit or lean upon the council table during sessions of the council.

#### (8)

Those having business before the council shall have the right to speak to items as they appear on the council agenda, subject to the constraints in subsections (c)(1) through (7) of this section.

#### (9)

Any person who violates any of the rules of conduct set out in this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by fine as provided by section 1-15 of this Code or shall be guilty of a municipal infraction punishable by a civil penalty as provided by section 1-15 of this Code.
