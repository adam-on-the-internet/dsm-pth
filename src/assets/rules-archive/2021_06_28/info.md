# V16: Council Forbids Consent Requests

June 28, 2021 - October 18, 2021

## Summary

These rules were amended at a Regular Council Meeting on June 28, 2021 as agenda item 1-I.

For over a year, the City had been putting controversial items (mainly regarding DMPD) on the Consent Agenda portion of the meeting, where Public Comment was forbidden. Members of the public could request items be removed, though those requests were rarely considered. With this amendment, the public was no longer allowed to make public requests in meetings to remove Consent Agenda items for discussion.

At the previous meeting (the first in-person meeting since COVID) members of the public requested an item be removed regarding a paid trip (~$10,000) to Florida for PERF Training for DMPD Officer Chad Steffen who lied under oath in attempt to prosecute a journalist for covering a BLM protest. Council denied the requests to remove the item and passed it unanimously.

These rules were put in place at the start of the meeting (around 5pm) and took effective immediately. That meant that at 5pm, council passed a requirement that anyone wishing to make a request must have made the request before 3pm, over 2 hours earlier.

The vote passed unanimously and no public comment was permitted. 

Rule 37. Action on Consent Agenda was amended as follows:

- If members of the public wish to request an item be pulled from the consent agenda, they must send a request to the City Clerk by 3pm the day of the meeting (via email, mail, or other writing).
- No such oral requests may be made at the meeting.
