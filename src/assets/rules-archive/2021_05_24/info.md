# V15: Changing Start Time and Motions to Recess

May 24, 2021 - June 28, 2021 

## Summary

Council expanded their ability to call for a "Recess" of meetings. They have continually attempted to use "Recess" to cancel meetings with anything the Mayor deems disruptive, as they have more legal protection to arrest people in "Recess" since that period is treated differently for Speech laws.

In the previous meeting, Public Comment was moved from the start to the end which created an awkward break between the start of the meeting at 4:30pm and the Hearings at 5:00pm. The start time was probably changed to address that.

The vote passed unanimously. The item was on the Consent Agenda, so no public comment was allowed. 

Rule 5. Regular Meetings was amended as follows:

- The Regular Meeting start time was moved from 4:30pm to 5:00pm.
- Council may now use motions to continue, postpone, or cancel various meetings.
- Hearings will take place immediately after the conclusion of the Consent Agenda instead of exactly at 5:00pm 

Rule 42. Motions was amended as follows:

- Any member of Council may now make a motion to recess or adjourn the meeting at any time and for any reason.
