Over the summer in 2020, as protests happened in the streets, the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement and other organizations started turning people out in mass to Des Moines City Council Meetings. This unprecedented public participation in Council Meetings prompted an unprecedented amount of rule changes as city government tried and failed, repeatedly, to silence Black voices and retaliate against speech critical of the city and DMPD.

These rule changes are complicated and petty, so we have attempted to document some of the context behind why the city changed certain rules.

We start with the most recent change and work backwards to the original rules. We will continue to update this as council continues to amend the rules. 

Some of this information may be inaccurate. It was created from city documents which are sometimes
incomplete or inaccurate.
