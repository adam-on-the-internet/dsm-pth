## Intro 

DES MOINES CITY COUNCIL MEETING 

City Hall, City Council Chambers 

400 Robert D Ray Drive 

Des Moines, Iowa 50309 

November 1, 2021 

5:00 P.M. 

Due to the increased community transmission of COVID-19 in Polk County, we have 

implemented a face covering requirement in City buildings. The requirement applies to both 

staff and the visiting public and includes attendance at Council meetings.  If you do not have a 

face covering, one will be provided for you. 

The public is hereby notified that the City Council will not tolerate disruption of its business 

meetings.  Persons wishing to attend this meeting are reminded of the following: 

We welcome germane comments from the public at the appropriate time, but this is a Council 

business meeting, and the Council needs to conduct the people�s business and Council has rules 

that are validly adopted under Iowa law and those rules will be followed. 

Anyone engaging in disruptive conduct in the Council Chambers or Great Hall will result in 

those   being disruptive being ordered to leave the building and being denied readmittance for the 

remainder of the day. 

No person will be permitted to stand in the council chamber during council sessions between 

the audience seats and the councilmembers except the persons addressing the council at the 

speakers� microphone and only after being recognized by the Mayor. 

All persons desiring to address the council may do so only when recognized by the Mayor, but 

the council reserves the right to limit the speaker's time and the order in which the speakers 

may address the council. 

Under Section 2-70 of the City Code, it is illegal to interrupt any person who is addressing the 

council except by a council member, and it is illegal to disrupt the Council meeting. 

EVERYONE in attendance has First Amendment rights and any disruptive conduct by one 

person or group impinges on the rights of others present, so disruptive conduct will not be 

tolerated. 

If the meeting is disrupted, the public speaking portion of the meeting may be moved to the 

next in-person meeting which is not disrupted. 

Those who disrupt the meeting will not be called on during the meeting, will be ordered to leave 

the building and may be cited or arrested for disorderly conduct, trespass or interfering with the 

good order of the meeting or other applicable charges. 

I.
