## Notes

The Blank Park Zoo has a private-public partnership with the City of Des Moines, so they occassionally provide updates and work in tandem with the city.

Council Member Gatto is especially interested in Zoo updates since the Zoo is in his ward (Ward 4). He has been vocal about this since the Des Moines Botanical Garden, which has a similar private-public partnership with the city, had recently gotten attention from council.
