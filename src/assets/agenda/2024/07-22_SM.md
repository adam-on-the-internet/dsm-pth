## Attention

This meeting violates Iowa Code 21.4 Public notice, which requires meetings to give notice of the "time, date, and place" of open meetings.

There is no time listed for the start of this meeting, instead it is listed as "immediately following Work Session"

## Highlighted Items

### Item 5

Ordinance amending Sections 102-8, 102-615 and 3-23 of the Municipal Code relating to
abandoned property and the removal of encroachments.

Waiver requested by Scott Sanders

Reduces time to claim abandoned property from 90 to 30 days

Reduces encroachment removal notices from 10 to three days

Additional changes to Removal Without Notice, Pre-Removal Hearing, and Post-Removal Hearing

### Item 6

Ordinance amending Chapter 102 of the Municipal Code relating to prohibited camping.

Waiver requested by Scott Sanders

Makes "camping" in public illegal, subject to $120 fine and immediate removal

Gives the city the ability to remove a "campsite" 24 hours after notice is given.
This seems to contradict item 5 which lowers the notice time from 10 to 3 days.

Gives the city the ability to "retain as evidence" items "weapons, drug paraphernalia, items appearing to be stolen, and evidence of a crime". 
Its not clear how an item would appear to be stolen or appear to be evidence of a crime.

### Item 7

Approving directions to City Manager when implementing an ordinance prohibiting
sleeping and camping on public property:

(A) Work with shelter operators, discuss current shelter practices and policies, and
identify ways to reduce barriers to emergency shelter use.
(B) Establish an agreement with an animal services provider to shelter animals of
unhoused individuals in Des Moines while individuals seek emergency shelter.
(C) Identify secured personal storage options for unhoused individuals.
(D) Establish a process making transportation available from campsites to emergency
shelter for individuals interested in entering emergency shelter. 

Council Directions suggesting City Manager should "assist in reducing perceived and actual barriers for people to use emergency shelters"

Item is vague and does not go into affect (its just a suggestion to the manager). While other items are rushed through in a single vote (instead of at 3 meetings as is the norm) this item shows the city is slow walking any semblance of assistance to homeless people.

### Item 8

Ordinance amending Sections 18-4 and 18-136 of the Municipal Code relating to
agricultural nondomestic animals and exotic animals and the types permitted.
