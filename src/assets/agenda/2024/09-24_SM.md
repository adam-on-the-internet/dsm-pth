## Notes

- Coleman virtual 
- Rick Neumann Family Playground & Sprayground at Gray's Lake [item](https://councildocs.dsm.city/resolutions/20240924/3.pdf)
    - Approving naming
    - Paid for by private funds, no city money, according to Voss
    - Boesen says she has known the Neumann family for a very long time. Sounds like a conflict of interest.
