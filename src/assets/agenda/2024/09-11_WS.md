## Notes

- Intro of meeting isn't on the recording. Recording starts partway through a 9/11 memorium.
- Primary Health Care presentation
    - city does not have expertise on outreach services - Sanders
    - PHC has been doing street outreach for over 15 years
    - currently 1 staffer, increase to 4
    - principles of engagement
        - Housing Firm
        - Harm Reduction
        - Progressive Engagement
    - talk of relationships with community partners, trust
    - connect to centralized intake, outreach services, basic needs
    - PHC is not 24/7, more things would have to change if that was the need (vague referencing to how ordinance may expect them to work)
    - Housing waitlist currently has over 750 people on it
    - Only 15% of people who come to centralized intake are referred to a housing resource, because funding resource doesn't grow from year to year
    - short on affordable housing units
    - Gatto says first contact would be with street outreach, not police (this doesn't align with the ordinances, it isn't required at all)
    - PHC says clearly, the issue won't change without more housing resources
        - Sanders mentions they should offer more incentives to landlords... obviously that is not the solution
        - Gatto rambles here trying to make the city sound good, it doesn't work he just sounds angry and defensive
        - Sanders also passes the buck to other places in Polk County
    - PHC says housing has been harder since the pandemic in part because smaller landlords sold to bigger firms that have more barriers to applicants
    - Boesen mentions meeting with Metro Advisory Council meeting about this
    - Mandelbaum mentions projects where the city is taking down affordable housing and building things like hotels or more expensive housing
        - Mandelbaum specifically mentions Invest DSM buying split homes around Drake and converting them to single family homes
        - "we have lost affordable units" and what we're doing is not keeping up with it
    - Land Trust reference as a potential solution
    - Some clients have to pay "double deposits"
        - One reason is criminal background, which would include the new ordinance's criminal charge
        - more mention of landlord incentives to try and pay landlords to take clients
    - Mandelbaum asks budget questions
        - PHC says the proposal was requested in March, provided it in April
        - Mandelbaum questions why they're adding 3 to get 4, when the resolution the city passed said they would hire 4
        - Sanders does bizarre doublespeak about this, says the resolution was only to hire 3... that very obviously was not the intent, Sanders is changing it
        - Sanders says he doesn't even want to "entertain" the idea of hiring 4, as that would make it an odd number that couldn't work in pairs. bizarre. calls adding the original 4th that was requested "lowering" the standards... when what they're doing (3 instead of 4) is obviously lowering the standards
        - Mandelbaum wants to give additional funds as well
        - Mandelbaum asks about funding commitment, his question is blocked by Sanders and Boesen
- Changes to the ordinances
    - Sanders doesn't even provide a slide for the some of the changes, this is really clearly rushed and they're avoiding documenting what they're doing
    - One change is to exclude minors. Sanders makes odd defensive comment that he doesn't think it would've applied to minors anyway (obviously this is just something they're saying to save face)
    - talk of how to coordinate with groups like Homeward and Homeless Coordinating Councils, Westergaard is asking and Boesen & Sanders are being defensive
        - will meet "as needed", so no routine schedule. this is STILL a mess, they still aren't taking this seriously
- Update on the 7 initiatives
    - Sanders calls them the "first" 7 initiatives
    - Sanders talks about a foster program with the ARL... that does not exist yet. says this is a good start, somehow
    - Sanders talks about $300,000, 2 year committment to funding PHC outreach workers
    - Sanders says the administrative judge is required to lower camp notice from 10 to 3 days... doesn't fully make sense
    - Westergaard says this is a "really good start", concern with safety of residents, there needs to be more "conversations" out in the community
        - says people don't feel safe seeing people with mental issues in public
    - Mandelbaum has questions and thoughts
        - "needs assessment" from Homeward, wants to know the status
            - was hopeful that with the entire month they've had on these items that there would at lesat be an update
        - still has questions on enforcement
        - Mandelbaum points out what's being suggested doesn't work. There was a recent encampment cleared due to resident complaints... two days later they were back
        - he doesn't really get clear answers, Sanders just kinda says things to shut him up
    - Voss asks about Skywalk. its split public/private
    - Gatto says that Sanders has been working "tirelessly" on this
    - by the cities own words...
        - 1. Work with shelter operators to reduce barriers 
            - city calls this "ongoing"
        - 2. Establish an agreement with an animal services provider to shelter animals of individuals experiencing homelessness in Des Moines whie they seek emergency shelter
            - city calls this "complete"... but Sanders verbally says that this doesn't exist and has just been a good start so far
        - 3. Identify secured personal storage options for people experiencing homelessness.
            - city calls this "in process"
        - 4. Establish a process making transporation available from campsites to emergency shelter for individuals interested in entering emergency shelter.
            - city calls this "complete"
        - 5. Add public restrooms in city parking garages
            - city calls this "complete". in reality, they put some port-a-potties outside 2 garages. that is good but it is not restrooms "in city parking garages" as the initiative ordered
        - 6. Have four outreach workers to engage with people experiencing homelessness in Des Moines and provide services to those individuals
            - city calls this "in process"
        - 7. Hire an hearing officer to expedite hearings in a shorter timeframe.
            - City calls this "in process"
