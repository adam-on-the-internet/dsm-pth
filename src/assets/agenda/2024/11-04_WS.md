## Notes

- Intro
- Consolidated Plan and Fair Housing Plan
    - [Consolidated Plan](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/Consolidated%20Plan.pdf)
    - [Fair Housing Plan](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/Fair%20Housing%20Plan.pdf)
    - demand exceeds capacity
    - populations are often unaware of their rights
    - NIMBY adds to these problems
    - The need to work with neighboring communities for a wholistic solution is mentioned. Boesen & Sanders have been actively sabotaging these relationships.
    - mention of fair housing training with DMPD for landlords
    - Mandelbaum asks how we're following through with this plan... notes that we are adopting it as a plan but seeingly not taking other action.
    - mention of community land trust
    - Mandelbaum mentions that parts of this have been ongoing but they haven't been brought up in the council's actions
    - Mandelbaum wants reports and tracking on progress, and notes changes on zoning code should be directed picked up
        - [clip](https://youtu.be/6gETIqQIOyk?t=1742)
    - Sanders pushes back on Mandelbaum, says this is just an analysis of impediments to fair housing and its meant to "influence plans"... what. "This is not meant to be a plan in of itself". Trying to distance council from the plan they're passing...
    - Mention of how this ties to the CAPER (which has shown the city failing to meet its goals)
    - Regional view recommended, especially for public outreach. Heard loudly from stakeholders.
    - talk of CDBG funds. there are some limits to how these funds are used.
    - Mayor Boesen asks council to submit questions privately after the work session instead of during. Note that discussion is typically the point of having these sessions

    - stated reason for this is to make data public
    - this ties back to some 21st century policing recommendations
    - talk of CALEA
    - Voss wants to have race/ethnicity on drivers license so cops don't have to "guess" ethnicity. Note that having the officers "guess" ethnicity in reports would actually be helpful, because the cop's assumption of the person's race is what matters.
