## Notes

- Video is missing the start of the meeting
- [Odor Enforcement Program](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/Odor%20Enforcement%20Program.pdf)
    - Talk of how the current methods are ineffective. People call, no action is taken, so they give up
    - Data has been mapped. 5 areas of complaints
    - Polluters can also see this data real time, and they contribute to it
        - Darling, Smithfield, City are splitting this about 1/3 each
    - Des Moines is taking an uncommon approach here, seems to be leading the way
    - Bit of ratfucking going on.... Mandelbaum points out the city bought into scientific sensors to eliminate personal bias with smell complaints. Now Sanders and others say we need to COMBINE the flawed complaint reporting with the scientific data rather than rely on the scientific data to enforce [clip](https://youtu.be/2G0nTP-8g6E?t=2534)
    - Lots of technical talk about readings
    - Seems that the polluters have spent money cleaning up their act in response to this study
