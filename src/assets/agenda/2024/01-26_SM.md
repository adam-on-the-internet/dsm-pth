## Notes

- Intro
    - Coleman + Mandelbaum remote
- Council votes unanimously to hold a special election for Boesen's vacant at-large seat on March 19, 2024
- From Axios 1/26 "DSM City Council was mistakenly advised by city staffers this week that the county auditor would set the date for a special election to fill the at-large seat left vacant by Connie Boesen's mayorship. So now the council will hold a special meeting today to schedule the election for March 19".
