## Notes

- Intro
    - The recording on YouTube starts partway into the meeting, while a presentation is already ongoing
- [Lower Fourmile Creek Greenway Master Plan](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/Fourmile%20Creek%20Greenway.pdf)
    - related to a Watershed plan
    - there was a huge flood here in 2018
    - involves Polk County Conservation
    - about 4 properties still in this property
- [Tax Abatement Update](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/Tax%20Abatement%20Presentation.pdf)
    - tax abatements given for many property improvements
    - city staff calls out incentives should more made to more align with the city's goals
    - these incentives are one tool of many
    - Westergaard upset about incentives related to EV charging. says its pushing people to the suburbs
    - talk of city partnering with developers to determine incentives... note that the city already meets with developers constantly
    - Coleman makes odd comments, seems to see Tax Abatement as a goal in itself (it is, on paper, supposed to be about rewarding developers who are working towards the city's goals, not just a handout for handouts sake)
    - Other Metro communities aren't even offering *any* incentives
    - Odd comment from Coleman that because the abatement line went up, its a success [clip](https://youtu.be/bNw1uLvKDIA?t=4163)
    - Next step will be an update early 2025
    - stakeholders will be developers, "as well as Residents"... (in the past they have excluded residents) [clip](https://youtu.be/bNw1uLvKDIA?t=4709)
