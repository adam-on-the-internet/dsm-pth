CISS has received $345,000 annually from the City through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program

The $345,000 of CDBG funding originally allocated to CISS for 2022, was reallocated to the
Property Improvement Program due to the delay in CISS’ required audit being conducted and
CDBG funding unable to be timely expended.

The City will provide CISS with $345,000 of funding from Local Option Sales and Service Tax
(LOSST) funding, previously allocated to the Property Improvement Program. As a part of the
agreement, the CISS Board of Director’s is being required to submit a letter to the City explaining
what caused the delay in the financial audit and assurances that steps have been taken to prevent
this in the future.
