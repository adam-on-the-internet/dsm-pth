    - Mention of controversy regarding partnership with Black Panthers, leading to Des Moines withdrawing support [clip](https://youtu.be/9qISxHcL1y4?t=274)
    - Council / City has a split relationship here... complicated history
    - Work in Housing, Energy, Health/Food, Local Focus (Needs)
    - When handing out assistance, many groups added conditions for assistance. Instead, this group made it a point to add no barriers beyond what was required for the funding.
    - They emphasized using as much funding as possible, any unused funds would be sent back to the source
    - Talk of temporary assistance vs long term help
    - Chris Coleman wants data on what Metro communities are putting in their fair share (affordable housing, etc)
    - Mike Simonson also wants regional metro data
    - Positive talk of basic income pilot (uplift)
- [American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/American%20Rescue%20Plan%20Act%20(ARPA)%20update.pdf)
    - "more than halfway through ARPA funding and expenditures"
    - ARPA funding spend restrictions have been loosened over time
    - Sanders seems to wish more of the ARPA funds went into the general fund
    - Airport terminal funding seems to have doubled ($5mill to $10mill), staff is kinda vague around this
    - About $51 mill passed through general funds to remove timeline restrictions
    - Mandelbaum points out that a lot of the ARPA expenditure information is confusing, even for council members
        - It is much more difficult to understand for the general public
    - Reading between the lines, something more is being talked around here. The city used ARPA fund for "routine" general fund commitments, and then took money out of the general fund to cover expenditures that wouldn't be ARPA-approved
        - The clear example of this is the Birdland Marina Project (this fund juggling was explained in a prior meeting) but I'm sure there are more cases that council is less open about.
    - Boesen points out that DSM was the only city to give ARPA funds to Bravo
        - Gatto adds the zoo, botanical center as similar beneficiaries
