## Notes

- Voss absent
- Sanders introduces meeting, says there is already an "incredible" about of budget information online
- First public commenter asks why a large portion of Des Moines properties don't pay property tax
    - about 40% of properties are exempt, includes some nonprofits, State Government, churches, etc
- Sanders answers questions, lots of property tax details
    - Sanders calls this 4/1/24 meeting the first part of the process with the public
- Very interesting that the state required these weird local public input meetings when the taxes are set by the State (pretty clear the State wants to direct anger to the Local levels)
- Sanders blames increased personnel costs on the 2 DMPD patrol officers targetting things like loitering, and a new Fire Department position
    - including IT and Equity positions as well
- Sanders brings up shifting city employee healthcare costs onto the employee as prices rise
- Sanders et al are giving much more deference to this public input than usual public input
- One speaker, president of the Taxpayers Association of Central Iowa, lives in Clive
    - speaks very fondly of the tax disclosure forms etc., praises Iowa Legislature for doing this, says it was bipartisan (all YES but 1)
    - Sanders rebuts the fondness for this bill, says it was passed with only 24 hour notice
    - seems to be an understanding the "first pass" of the notices was bad
- Gatto acknowledges its hard to maintain police & fire budgets (constant pay increases) with the current setup for local funding
- meeting lasted about 30 minutes, 3 speakers
