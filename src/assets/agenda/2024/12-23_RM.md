## Notes

- Voss is remote
- Mandelbaum "pulls" consent item 42
    - fees hadn't been caught up in quite some time
    - council generally supports Mandelbaum in catching this up to cost neutral, even Gatto, and Sanders seems to be slow walking
- Item 46
    - Mandelbaum supports but wants to give public more time to digest, wants to wait until January. Council refuses to wait
- Item 50-I
    - this was originally on the consent agenda
    - Mandelbaum tries to speak, Boesen blocks him to first get a motion on the table
    - Mandelbaum likes project but not development agreement. Boesen mad that he wants to talk about the development agreement.
    - Mandelbaum wants transparency and proof of insurance
    - Mandelbaum comparing to Cedar Rapids agreements
    - Simonson wants to approve
    - Westergaard feels they are being rushed, says there have been sidebar conversations instead of open discussion
    - you can watch the "race to the bottom" in real time. this site has sat vacant and now the city is rushing into the first offer that comes up.
    - Coleman wants to approve
    - For the 100000th time council is saying they want verifiable payroll but refusing to actually work towards it
    - Sanders says verifiable payroll would "make no sense". notes it has been discussed in previous workshops (and ignored) but they can discuss it again
    - Sanders is the negotiator in these things, and he's a shit negotiator
    - lol Sanders says this is the best deal possible, then tells council to vote for his deal so they can "celebrate" [clip](https://youtu.be/hsfFaEn49BA?t=2517)
    - Westergaard notes they discussed apprenticeship programs 1 year ago and it got sidelocked [clip](https://youtu.be/hsfFaEn49BA?t=2545)
    - Boesen "nothing is simple", has no points, just says we need to rush into this immediately
    - Mandelbaum notes they were supposed to have a public work discussion on this, and it was replaced with private small group work sessions [clip](https://youtu.be/hsfFaEn49BA?t=2660)
    - Mandelbaum notes that if the city council refuses to have open policy discussion outside of these agreements, this is the only time to discuss it
    - Mandelbaum mentions that the developer told him the city didn't even mention these items (that means Sanders intentionally ignored the topic)
    - Boesen claims "we have never discussed it before" LOL. you can find news articles about her blocking discussion about this multiple times
    - Simonson wants to put this discussion on calendar, Boesen blocks this request [clip](https://youtu.be/hsfFaEn49BA?t=2792)
    - Gatto starts ranting that Cedar Rapids doesn't have 33 story buildings... weird. The point is that even Cedar Rapids requires this, so why wouldn't we, a bigger city?
    - Boesen rushes vote, blocks further discussion. No public comment.
    - Ends up with 7 YES
