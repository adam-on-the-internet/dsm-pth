## Notes

- Voss Remote, Gatto Absent
- About 25 people over room capacity (in overflow)
- Questions in early meeting from the public about Sidewalk commitment
- Item 35, lot of talk about "Council Directive" updates... bizarre tone
    - Coleman says "people have been very engaged"... they're shook by how much pushback they've gotten, and they're admitting it
    - More changes to language for 3rd reading... but for some reason no new language is here for this second reading
    - Simonson wants: No Fine, Mental Health Team
    - Mandelbaum questions: Missing Fiscal Impact, Rental Assistance
    - Sanders: rambles a lot, more cagey than usual
    - Coleman rambles a lot
    - Boesen talks the Metro Advisory Council. Says something weird about how (allegedly) 50% of the homeless population's last known address isn't in Des Moines. Weird accussations that don't mean what she thinks and aren't backed by evidence anyway.
    - Sanders moves the ball from last meeting. Before, city said they would wait to enforce until directives have been met. Now, he says that the 3rd reading's passage indicates to him the directives have been met. 
    - Mandelbaum questions storage and why its so far away (and not even connected to DART really), doesn't meet standards for National Law Center on Homelessness
    - Sanders gives odd comment about "2 types of storage"... isn't really an answer
    - Mandelbaum asks if transport to shelters is being offered by anyone other than police, or if that's an option
    - Sanders "we would need to change the interaction"
    - Mandelbaum asks about "goal of compliance", if they comply to move, but just sleep elsewhere? do they get cited again?
    - Sanders, they're not being asked to move, they're being asked to "Not sleep"... what?
    - Mandelbaum, where are they supposed to go?
    - Sanders has no answer
    - Conversation with CISS on July 31 was mentioned
    - Boesen has odd question about medical issues
    - No public comment is allowed
    - Mandelbaum talking about impact... gets applause. I missed exact comment
    - Sanders gets laughed at.... Boesen quiets the audience down
    - Mandelbaum, we're in this problem because we aren't keeping up with housing, we're treading water at best.
        - we should build housing with the urgency we're moving to enforce
    - Boesen "we all need to do more", regional issue
    - Mandelbaum, others doing poorly doesn't excuse us
    - applause
    - Simonson switches to YES, only NO is Mandelbaum
- Item 36
    - Mandelbaum asks about behavior of sleeping. wants to enforce what is on the books before adding this.
    - Simonson switches to YES, only NO is Mandelbaum
- Item 56-I
    - Odd, vague item. I can't tell what they're actually talking about. Moving to september for discussion.
- overflow still occupied during public comment
- Public Comment notes...
    - 11 speakers on Chicken issue
    - 6 speakers on homelessness, including polk county attorney kimberley graham
    - max speakers, some didn't show up
    - as usual, disparity in whose mic gets cut off at time limit (E was cutoff, H wasn't at first)
