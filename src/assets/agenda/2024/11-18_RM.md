- Consent Notes:
    - voss 5 no

    - coleman 24 speak
    - simonson 29 abstain
- discussion on pool repair bids being rejected. Westergaard disappointed. Item 40.
- Coleman & Boesen break procedure to allow comment on item 24, to allow people to comment on a potential low income housing project
    - Coleman says he "pulled" this item... he didn't, he said he wanted to speak on it
    - some neighbors complain
    - Coleman says he hasn't actually reviewed the information so he can't support it. calls for more "public process", which would be his responsibility
    - Mandelbaum speaks in support, gives example of similar project in his ward
    - Coleman weirdly whiny, even for him. Keeps complaining about "process" but is not clear at all what "process" was wrong/missing
    - Boesen seems to support (this is just grant funding)
    - Coleman is the only NO (even Gatto is YES)
    - Greater Des Moines Supportive Housing speaks to support project
