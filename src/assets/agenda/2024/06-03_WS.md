## Notes

- [Construction Manager at Risk (CMaR)](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/Construction%20Manager%20at%20Risk.pdf)
    - City Staff / engineering presenting
    - "Design Bid Build" Flow chart
    - lot of followup on questions about contractors and qualification
    - the example project here is the animal control facility
    - there seems to be debate over the criteria that can be used to choose contractors. for instance, whether legal issues can be considered
    - Coleman has concerns about how these CMAR items are disclosed publicly, says the agenda was unclear (min 48 mark)
- [1200 Locust Update](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/1200%20Locust%20Street.pdf)
    - New (larger) council chambers planned. On level one, which is better for accessibility (today, you have to access a blocked-off elevator to get to the floor 2 chambers)
    - Phase 2 includes Police HQ, Phase 3 (I hadn't heard of til now) includes Police Academy and MetroSTAR (SWAT)
    - some talk about new dmpd hq and other items that have never been voted on by council. not sure how these plans are proceeding without vote
    - plans are for the new council chambers being on a floor mostly dedicated to police
    - previously, commercial space would remain. seems like that has been cut out for "security" reasons related to dmpd
