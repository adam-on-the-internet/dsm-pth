## Notes

- ...
- Some of this work will be handled by neighborhood works / public works staff [clip](https://youtu.be/0Scm0BpUE-s?t=1023)
    - this means some work (like vacant property registry) will be reduced to make time for this
- ...
- for "Affirmative Defense" Coleman has invented to avoid the $50 fine, the homeless people need to lawyer up after they get a citation
    - they have to "prove" after the fact that it is impracticable to take shelter
- Mayor Boesen cuts off Mandelbaum from asking questions about community service, saying they can be discussed later [clip](https://youtu.be/0Scm0BpUE-s?t=2639)
    - this is not the first time Boesen has insisted that public discussion of a topic was not appropriate when Mandelbaum was speaking. It is unclear when she thinks discussion of agenda items is appropriate.
- Mandelbaum asks how this will be enforced. It is no longer complaint-based, the city will issue on its own. So is the city going to send out people to find the ~150 people sleeping outside every night and give them citations? Other councillors say that is not the intent.
    - Coleman gets very mad about this and throws a tantrum, the audience laughs at his tantrum
    - Coleman wants to drive "respect for rule of order"
    - Mandelbaum and Coleman discuss back and forth, Boesen cuts them both off and closes the work session. 
    - Beyond ending a normal discussion during a discussion time, this is bizarre... there is a way to adjourn they didn't follow (Rule 42)
