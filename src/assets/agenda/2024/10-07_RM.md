The intent of the Small Business Impact Loan program is to encourage the establishment, stabilization,
expansion, and scaling of small businesses within the City of Des Moines. These small dollar, shortterm Small Business Impact Loans will have minimum loan amount of $5,000 and a maximum loan
amount of $20,000. Depending on the size of the loan and scope of the project, repayment periods will
range from three (3) to five (5) years. Interest rates will be fixed at two (2) points under prime at the
time of loan origination. Applicants must demonstrate lack of access to traditional funding due to
limited credit history or lack of collateral.
Small Business Impact Loan requests for business enterprises in vacant and/or underutilized
commercial properties will be prioritized. A scoring preference will be given to certified Targeted
Small Businesses, socially or economically disadvantaged persons as defined by US Small Business
Act, and businesses eligible for LGBT Business Enterprise (LGBTE) certification through the National
LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC). Approved borrowers will be required to utilize technical
assistance provided by the Office of Economic Development (OED) small business staff and connect
with one (1) or more small business-focused community organizations (One Economy Financial
Development Corporation, Evelyn K. Davis Center for Working Families, Iowa Center for Economic
Success, etc.) for additional support.
