## Notes

- Intro
    - First meeting with Boesen as Mayor
    - Coleman absent at first, seems to have arrived late
    - Boesen's council member at-large seat now empty (election or appointment has not yet been declared)
- [Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden Update](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/Botanical%20Garden%20City%20Council%20Presentation.pdf)
    - Talk of what all the garden does (they manage some things beyond the botanical garden itself)
    - Park is not safe to open at night due to lack of lighting- they want to change that
- [Additions to Chapter 42, Article VI, for Weed and Grass Enforcement](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/Weed%20and%20Grass%20Enforcement.pdf)
    - Polk County used to provide this, but now city has to take it over
    - Cost of abatements, $51,565.50
    - talk of repeat offenders, vacant lots
    - Policy Considerations:
        - Honor "No Mow May"?
        - current standard is 12" height
        - potential additional of language for clearing & grubbing for "unmanaged" woody vegetation
    - council seems to want to toss out "no mow may"
    - around 36 minute mark, a bunch of councillors speak off mic or otherwise inaudible
    - council may want to lower 12" to 10"
        - council wants to pay more to be stricter on grass, to send a message
- [Amendments to Chapter 60 as relates to Rental Inspections](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2024/Rental%20Inspections%20Chapter%2060.pdf)

        - Appeals Board
        - Consistency with other codes
        - Public nuisance deficiency language
        - Wording and scrivener's errors
    - City Staff notes their understanding of the code is limited due to limited council discussion from when it was passed
        - this is related to heating in rentals. during COVID there was an issue where apartment buildings were without heat
        - Westergaard calls some inspections of rental units a "burden", Mandelbaum seems to agree
    - Coleman complaining about regulations and how they limit what site owners do
        - "great" vs "good", plea for diversity... really sounds bad faith de-regulation take
        - current process limits small changes without a site plan
    - Mandelbaum brings up lack of lead service line code
        - Westergaard says she does not support requiring landlords to replace lead service lines [clip](https://youtu.be/XtC63M7soM0?t=5681)
        - Mandelbaum brings up Jackson, Mississippi issue with lead
        - Mandelbaum wants to "chip away" at the problem of lead service lines, identified by Des Moines Water Works
        - Westergaard says "many landlords do not make a profit, that's not why they're doing it" ... [clip](https://youtu.be/XtC63M7soM0?t=5973)
- Harvard
    - Not on the agenda, but Boesen brought up 3 students from the Harvard Public Policy Program [clip](https://youtu.be/XtC63M7soM0?t=6124)
