## Notes

- Off-cycle meeting for appointment of new police chief
- video has long bit of pre-meeting w/o audio
- Gatto is virtual
- Coleman comments 
    - thanks Sanders for selection and mentions connection w/ Sanders' resignation (and unresignation) is somewhwat related
    - high praises for Wingert. "There's never been a moment we couldn't take your word to the bank."
    - happy with internal hire
- Westergaard says she heard for "countless" people in Ward 2 and all were happy with McTaggart (this is obvious lie, residents at meetings she was in say they wanted a different candidate) [clip](https://youtu.be/lqrNYv15fJI?t=770)
- very little discussion, very short meeting
