## Notes

- Attendance
    - Masked: Cownie, Lester
    - Unmasked: Boesen, Gatto, Sanders, Westergaard
- Fiscal Year 2024 City Manager’s Budget Recommendation
    - Sanders talks some about work that goes into budget before it is released
- [Operations (General Fund, Road Use Tax, Local Option)](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Operations%20-%20General%20Fund,%20Road%20Use%20Tax,%20Local%20Option.pdf)
    - Presented by Joe
    - Some of the additional service levels:
        - "public safety equity" position
        - Tall grass program
        - Increased wages for seasonal staff
        - Police in-car camera replacement program
    - Sheumaker references Sanders' earlier remarks (from 2020) that police salaries expanding will outpace revenue
        - Sanders oddly tries to half-deny this
        - Police is highest personnel cost
        - Gatto asks if Sheumaker wants to defund the police, obvious yes. He then whines that a majority doesn't support her
        - Sheumaker has to affirm that while the majority doesn't support the position, she has a right to speak her position (note that Gatto and Westergaard constantly rant about positions that are not popular)
        - As usual, Cownie doesn't cut Gatto off but does cut Sheumaker off
        - [clip](https://youtu.be/S3VVdiJIC2w?t=1124)    
        - This is very direct... Gatto spent the Monday meeting talking about Defunding DART, but interjects to Sheumaker even mentioning that she wants to Defund DMPD (which she ran and won on)
    - Talk about food assistance / food insecurity
    - Talk of firefighter drama

    - Presented by Nick Shaul
    - lotsa numbers in the slides
    - Enterprise Funds
    - talk of pool & gym availability
    - talk of Water Trails removing trees, "all the experts" have reviewed this... "we're following the rules, regardless of how bad it is" energy. "its been reviewed and is necessary"
    - lot of discussion around neglected roads and Ward funding disparities around 1:38:00. Good points by Gatto.
- council will meet with manager Monday (privately) to discuss further. Some things coming back for work sessions 
- It is jarring how little control council (and the public) has over the budget at this phase. It is presented as "here is what we did, now it needs to be approved or we'll be late".
