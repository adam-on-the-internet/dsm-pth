    - presented by Chris Johanssen
    - focused on rental property
    - Westergaard tries to make legal arguments around 1:14:00, Lester has to jump in
        - Westergaard is trying to litigate an ordinance around one specific legal case someone emailed her about
        - seems she wants to use city staff to help insurance/litigation for property owners. not necessarily bad, but odd considering her libertarian comments.
    - these legal issues are complicated (one person's tree hangs over another's property, etc)
