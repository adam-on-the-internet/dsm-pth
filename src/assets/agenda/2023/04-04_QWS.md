    - talk of "tracking" people/visitors
    - talk of conventions and other events
- [Unsheltered Des Moines Study](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Unsheltered%20Des%20Moines%20Study.pdf)
    - Presented by Chris and Angie of Homeward. Had been presented elsewhere prior.
    - Amber Lewis hired at city's homeless policy admin
    - Increase in homelessness nationally and locally
    - involved with "extreme weather work group"
    - study team surveyed 152 "persons experiencing homelessness living unsheltered in Polk County" and had "37 in-depth interviews" of that population
    - planning began in Feb '22 and data collection occured June-October '22
    - Keys
        - Barriers to Housing
        - Lived Expertise
        - Extensive Research
        - What Can We Do Better?
    - Lots of detail throughout, I won't note all
    - Emphasis on showing that the homeless population is varied in many ways, not a single problem or solution
    - Currently, services are "prioritized", meaning that the city does not have enough services to fit the population so they are rationed (not everyone who qualifies/deserves access gets it, people are explicitly left out)
    - Westergaard specifically concerned with how homeless people from other areas end up in Polk County 
    - JOPPA doesn't cooperate/work-with this group. Staffing issues with JOPPA... they've been offered help training but haven't accepted. Hearing this makes Westergaard defensive and she claims JOPPA has a different "spin" she'd like to hear. Gatto points out JOPPA has been untrustworthy (vaguely). Note that Westergaard asks about JOPPA, and when the speaker answers negatively Westergaard says she doesn't think its fair to talk about JOPPA when they're not there to defend themselves...
    - talk of homeless services during covid emergency
    - council asks if another city is a good example for winter services, no clear answer given
    - questions about how to fund

    - Presented by Johnathan Gano Public Works Director
    - Talk of Equality vs Equity
    - Talk of language services
    - Sanders talks about difficulty for first-time buyers
        - good talk but also odd. expressing dismay at rising housing prices... but the city's mission is to increase housing prices
        - some confusion about this around council too...
- Council Board Updates
