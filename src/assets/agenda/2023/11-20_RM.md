## Notes

- Mandelabaum is virtual, call quality is low
- Coleman's first meeting since retirement
- Consent Notes:
    - Cownie NO on 5
    - Mandelbaum SPEAK on 22, 24
- Lots of comment on item 45 (https://councildocs.dsm.city/resolutions/20231120/45.pdf)
    - about rezoning to open a new apartment building
    - commentors are generally supportive of the new apartment building
    - some commentors are against, heavily
    - concerns about "density"
    - Personal note- its always "not the right time/place" for density
    - LOTS of speakers
    - some special rental certificate rule in play here
    - riverbend
    - this was previously a single-family home
    - city is loose on speaking times here
    - Chris Coleman "Your Ward 1 council member has something to say, haven't heard that for awhile"
    - Item was apparently delayed so that Chris Coleman could represent Ward 1 on this item
    - Coleman wants to deny this, is against density
    - Lots of "concern" broadly
    - Mandelbaum speaks, says its a "close call" but defers to ward councilperson
- lot of crosstalk and snickering from council members (maybe Gatto? hard to tell) throughout meeting
- Mandelbaum speaks on 22 & 24, about development agreements
    - [Related Article](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/development/2023/11/21/clash-over-apartments-development-marks-first-post-election-des-moines-city-council-meeting-boesen/71661501007/)
    - Says he likes these projects
    - Says the city is too "content" to just hand out assistance, we should be maximizing our leverage for public benefit
    - Talks about lack of discussion on these handouts
    - Lot of interesting points, but rambling a lot
    - Its clear Mandelbaum is fed up with how little the rest of council cares about these incentives
    - talk of the development agreement sometimes incentivizing leaving things vacant vs renting to small business
    - Mandelbaums main point, among the ramble, seems to be that staff needs direction from council on this so Mandelbaum is asking council to consider it
    - talk of requiring people receiving incentives to follow federal laws
    - Cownie speaks against all this, is mad about "25 minutes" of comments. Asks if there is a second
    - Gatto says "there is no second" (odd, that's not how seconding things works...) and goes into rant against Mandelbaum
    - Cownie cuts Gatto off "political" conversation
    - Westergaard speaks
    - Everyone seems to say "there are some things Mandelbaum said that we support... but we're against this anyway"
    - Also note Cownie's tone of a frequent council refrain I'd paraphase to "the decision on the agenda has already been made, we have to vote YES" which is a lie, that's not how council votes work
    - On 24, Westergaard actually seems to support Mandelbaum. Gatto fights
    - Council broadly is saying this conversation should be in a work session... but Cownie and others have worked to prevent Mandelbaum from setting Work Session topics. If it should've been a work session topic and it was missed, that's on the Mayor and City Manager
- Some further discussion around the Donation Bin Regulations (#49)
- Public Comment notes
    - public speakers are still being told by someone/something that they get 5 minutes, even though its actually 2 minutes
    - CCI Racial Justice out speaking again
    - Westergaard left the room during public comment, awkwardly misses a vote on an agenda item after public comment
- Water regionalization supported unanimously
