## Notes

- Intro
    - Attendance: Cownie, Gatto, Mandelbaum, Boesen, Westergaard, Voss, Lester, Sanders (all unmasked)
- [Neighborhood Association Update](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Neighborhood%20Association%20Update.pdf)
    - Presented by Heather Tamminga Neighborhood Outreach Coordinator
    - Lots of interesting talk about Neighborhood Associations (NAs) that is usually kept in backrooms
    - City aiming to offer services Neighborhood Associations
        - Neighborhood Association Toolkit
        - Neighborhood Leadership Workshops
        - Neighborhood Grants ($1,000 from the city), requiring things like nonprofit status
    - Recommendations for FY24 (detailed in video & slides)
    - Lots more discussion
    - Sanders wants council to take leaders (for board positions, etc) from NAs, "young leaders"
    - Mandelbaum talks about how neighborhood boards don't represent demographics of neighborhoods, implies we shouldn't be amplifying that by grabbing leaders from that system
        - [clip](https://youtu.be/QmXLyIG74E8?t=1790)
        - said more simply, the NAs skew white and higher class (who has time to participate and is willing to do this, etc)
        - may "perpetuate some inequalities" systemically
        - Sanders brushes this off and doesn't allow presenter to answer
- [CARE Program Update](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/CARE%20Program%20Update.pdf)
    - [Additional Doc](https://www.dsm.city/newsimages/2023/07_July/CARE.pdf?pdf=CARE%20Team%20presented%20conclusions&t=1689614611807)
    - Presented by Lorna Garcia
    - Sanders says these are opportunities for nonprofits (why does this have to be private when police are public?)
    - Mainly coordinated with Boradlawns
    - CARE = Crisis Advocacy Response Effort
    - Lots of detail in slides
    - "Mobile Crisis Response Team" (MCRT) also mentioned, Polk County level
    - AMOS (A Mid-Iowa Organizing Strategy) mentioned in creation of CARE
    - At one point, someone yelling from audience? Can't really understand on video. Seems to be someone from Broadlawns
    - Mandelbaum asking questions seemingly aimed at pushing more funding for CARE
        - talk about combining medical expertise out in the field. on top of obvious benefits, this also keeps people out of the ER. this is one clear reason for the coordination with Broadlawns (as opposed to just a public entity)
    - At the end, Cownie asks a question that (basically) Mandelbaum asked earlier about if staffing overnight makes sense. They said they actually don't see these calls overnight often. Cownie just kinda mumbles about this after it is answered (twice)
