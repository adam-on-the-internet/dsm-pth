    - Prep for "Connect Downtown" and "MoveDSM"
    - Managing curb uses / conflicts (loading zone vs parking, etc)
    - new curb management process planned out
    - Gatto whining that he wants maintenance considered in this process (even though it is explicitly a separate issue)

- [Future Forward](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Future%20Forward.pdf)
    - Representatives (Matt and Tiffany) from the partnership presenting
    - Big plan... quick discussion
    - Partnership claims they are "Giving people voices" (unsure exact wording)
    - Partnership has odd concepts of trying to push people to be downtown
    - Lots of discussion about the skywalk. Voss seems to want to tear them down because homeless people exist in them.
        - More than 30 different skywalk agreements
        - talk of lack of public restrooms downtown
    - talk of downtown connectivity
    - lots of legitimately cool plans from the partnership but its not clear to me how the Partnership would have authority to do them
    - Sheumaker calls out notes in presentation that appear as gentrification
        - Says plan has a lot of merit but fails to even mention gentrification
        - Partnership talks about "pulling ideas out of neighborhood" rather than "pushing ideas into neighborhoods", but they're here at this meeting pushing ideas into neighborhoods.
    - Cownie gives speech about downtown culture/history stuff. Likes that national media says nice things about downtown.

            - lots going on
    - Cownie
        - Gives an update (?) that is just "same..." weird
- Update on Police Projects
    - No presentation included (?)
    - Presented by Police Chief Dana Wingert
        - Care & Mobile Crisis
            - "Buzzword"
            - county involvement
            - visited austin, texas
            - involves a few named officers, including Garcia & O'Neil
            - lots of vagueness, bragging. Some good info but from what I know this is dodgy rose-colored information
            - Sheumaker gets some info out of Wingert. tw// potential suicide with a gun is treated as a weapons-threat incident to send out officers
                - Wingert says "1 or 2" officers may come on these calls, but that's not really true. 4+ officers sometimes come to these calls
                - after challenged, Wingert admits that 4+ can happen in somewhat-exceptional scenarios. More vagueness and dodginess.
            - Broadlawns
            - Cownie cuts of Sheumaker's questions to Wingert around 2:50:00
        - 30 over 30
            - aims to get department 30% female by 2030
            - Sheumaker connects to question of the "culture of the department" in separate effort
    - Presented by Captain Josh Ramey
        - "Ethos" Climate Survey
        - Takeaways:    
            - Mental health solutions, positive impact / Reduce mental health stigma within department
            - Lower morale driven by "perceived lack of support from those in authority, lack of community support, current political climate"
            - Enhancing morale: they want to amplify positive messages about police basically. PR & internal "recognition". "how to foster community".
        - Lots of of ideas from this guy. not really sure what the presentation is...
    - Presented by Sargaent Brian O'Donnell
        - heading up accrediting process for CALEA
        - seeking "basic" level
        - "will give us a measure of where we stand"
        - Sheumaker asks, what is the different between accredited and unaccredited departments?
            - answered that they are used to compare / compete departments basically? suburbs (urbandale, west dsm) already competing
        - Sheumaker asks directly about if the Nationwide building is being planned for the police
            - Sanders jumps in to half-deny. This is clearly being planned but is not above-board decision-wise (backroom deals say yes but its not technically confirmed)
            - Sanders says it is years down the line. (1 year design, 1 year construction. 3 most realistic)
        - Nov '24, just over 2 years, for initial
        - data data data
        - eventually wants advanced accredidation
        - Again, Cownie tries to end early but then Mandelbaum and Sheumaker have more questions
        - To conclude, because Sheumaker asked a question about Urbandale vs DSM, Cownie asks for numbers of calls for service of Urbandale vs DSM and then laughs when he hears the relatively low Urbandale number. Just odd behavior 
    - Presented by ? (no name given?)
        - 21st century policing      
        - The community outreach is very... frought lol. lots of police supports and "not supporters" etc. relying on existing power structures like Neighborhood Associations
        - Gatto is heated for the first time in this meeting. Seems very interested in "neighborhood meetings"
        - Also about Public Works, LLC
        - talk of gaps in data systems... new data systems... an "expert" in Tyler systems left for Grimes
        - Gatto heated again... about lack of tech staffing? seems odd
        - Talk of moving from verbal warnings (in lieu of citations) to written warnings, which would actually go in system and could rack up
        - Westergaard makes comment about presentation at Women's Conference
- Closing remarks
    - Sanders mentions tall grass special work session
