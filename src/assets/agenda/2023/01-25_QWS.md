- [Curbside Management](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Curbside%20Management.pdf)
    - John Davis, City Traffic Engineer, presenting
    - Prep for "Connect Downtown" and "MoveDSM"
    - Managing curb uses / conflicts (loading zone vs parking, etc)
    - new curb management process planned out
    - Gatto whining that he wants maintenance considered in this process (even though it is explicitly a separate issue)
    - Cownie voices complaints from Ingersoll businesses about lack of street parking. Note that Cownie's business, "Cownie Furs" is on Ingersoll
- [Future Forward](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Future%20Forward.pdf)
    - Representatives (Matt and Tiffany) from the partnership presenting
    - Big plan... quick discussion
    - Partnership claims they are "Giving people voices" (unsure exact wording)
    - Partnership has odd concepts of trying to push people to be downtown
    - Lots of discussion about the skywalk. Voss seems to want to tear them down because homeless people exist in them.
        - More than 30 different skywalk agreements
        - talk of lack of public restrooms downtown
    - talk of downtown connectivity
    - lots of legitimately cool plans from the partnership but its not clear to me how the Partnership would have authority to do them
    - Sheumaker calls out notes in presentation that appear as gentrification
        - Says plan has a lot of merit but fails to even mention gentrification
        - Partnership talks about "pulling ideas out of neighborhood" rather than "pushing ideas into neighborhoods", but they're here at this meeting pushing ideas into neighborhoods.
    - Cownie gives speech about downtown culture/history stuff. Likes that national media says nice things about downtown.
