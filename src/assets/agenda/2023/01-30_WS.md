    - Presented by Chris Johansen (Neighborhood Services Director)
    - follow-up to earlier work session (on 1/9/23)
    - Since 2018, 8,845 violated cases (complaints)
        - 2,695 of those occurred on the same property more than once, so MANY repeat offenders
        - Violated case: step beyond complaint, broader numbers unclear such as when city took action
        - no mow may considered
        - some of council wants to skip or rush appeal process
            - appeals crucial for things like pollinator gardens or other less standard situations
            - "there HAS to be some sort of administrative review" but could do in-house to rush (?) - Lester, City Attorney
