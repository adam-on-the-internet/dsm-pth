- Introduction
    - Presented by Nick Shaul
- [Parking Enterprise](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Parking%20Enterprise.pdf)
    - Presented by Joe Brensterd (?)
    - City has 7 parking garages
    - Downtown parking
        - 5k garage spots
        - 3k street spots
        - 8k total parking spots
    - Garage usage dropped since COVID
        - Presumably due in part to hybrid/remote work. but no firm numbers to show that.
    - Gatto asks City Manager Sanders what the city's plan is to "get more people back in seats and back in the offices"
        - Sanders says he has weekly meetings w/ Matt Anderson (deputy city manager) w/ Greater DM Partnership
        - For city staff 10% that are office jobs, "alternative work arrangement" 2 days a week optional work from home. about 6% of workforce utilizes some form of that
        - Gatto is critical of allowing remote work. Wants to use the city to push people into office. Weird!
        - Gatto's argument is that the City should use its power to pressure employers and employees to work in the office so that city parking garages are used more....

        - Sheumaker rebutts Gatto, saying the City should be realistic about the new model of work that will likely last our lifetimes.
        - Gatto goes back to his old argument that the city should privatize its parking garages
        - Sheumaker says she'd like to redevelop parking garages instead. Sanders says that is best to do when a garage needs repair, 4th and grand garage would be the next but is about 6-8 years out.
    - lots of numbers on the slides
    - ParkDSM talk as well
    - Gatto keeps being incredibly argumentative. Supposed to be a discussion but instead he's just picking fights. Weird!
        - Gets into his DEFUND DART shit in talk about parking enterprise... weird. Snaps at Sheumaker
        - Gatto complains that buses "aren't always full" and suggests buses should run at just peak hours
        - weird rant, summarized by this moment when Sheumaker begins to offer ideas and Gatto says he doesn't want solutions, he just wants to whine [clip](https://youtu.be/K9MbjYOGnKI?t=1980)
