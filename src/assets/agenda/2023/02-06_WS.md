- Introduction
    - Presented by Nick Shaul
- [Parking Enterprise](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Parking%20Enterprise.pdf)
    - Presented by Joe Brensterd (?)
    - City has 7 parking garages
    - Downtown parking
        - 5k garage spots
        - 3k street spots
        - 8k total parking spots
    - Garage usage dropped since COVID
        - Presumably due in part to hybrid/remote work. but no firm numbers to show that.
    - Gatto asks City Manager Sanders what the city's plan is to "get more people back in seats and back in the offices"
        - Sanders says he has weekly meetings w/ Matt Anderson (deputy city manager) w/ Greater DM Partnership
        - For city staff 10% that are office jobs, "alternative work arrangement" 2 days a week optional work from home. about 6% of workforce utilizes some form of that
        - Gatto is critical of allowing remote work. Wants to use the city to push people into office. Weird!
        - Gatto's argument is that the City should use its power to pressure employers and employees to work in the office so that city parking garages are used more....
        - [clip](https://youtu.be/K9MbjYOGnKI?t=485)
        - Sheumaker rebutts Gatto, saying the City should be realistic about the new model of work that will likely last our lifetimes.
        - Gatto goes back to his old argument that the city should privatize its parking garages
        - Sheumaker says she'd like to redevelop parking garages instead. Sanders says that is best to do when a garage needs repair, 4th and grand garage would be the next but is about 6-8 years out.
    - lots of numbers on the slides
    - ParkDSM talk as well
    - Gatto keeps being incredibly argumentative. Supposed to be a discussion but instead he's just picking fights. Weird!
        - Gets into his DEFUND DART shit in talk about parking enterprise... weird. Snaps at Sheumaker
        - Gatto complains that buses "aren't always full" and suggests buses should run at just peak hours
        - weird rant, summarized by this moment when Sheumaker begins to offer ideas and Gatto says he doesn't want solutions, he just wants to whine [clip](https://youtu.be/K9MbjYOGnKI?t=1980)
- [Sanitary Sewer Enterprise](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Sanitary%20Sewer%20Enterprise.pdf)
    - Presented by Nick Schaul
    - Cownie talks about upstream pollution (around 48:00)
- [Solid Waste](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Solid%20Waste%20Enterprise.pdf)
    - Presented by Nick Schaul
    - involves Scrub events
    - now have winter equipment in a garage, so the salt is warm (easier treatment)
- [Stormwater Enterprise](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Stormwater%20Enterprise.pdf)
    - Presented by Nick Schaul
    - talk of levee improvement status
- [Housing Services](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Housing%20Services.pdf)
    - Presented by Joe (?)
    - Talk of Section 8 & Public Housing
    - Talk of how Section 8 can come from/to other parts of the country
    - City seems to be selling off public housing and moving that money to shelters (like CISS). Sheumaker says this is reverse of what she'd like (housing first means housing > shelters).
- [Self-Supported Municipal Improvement Districts](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Self-Supported%20Municipal%20Improvement%20Districts.pdf)
    - Presented by Nick Schaul
    - "SSMIDs"
    - Gatto lies in the meeting and says that SW9th SMMID money is just going to the city's general fund (trying to rile up the "taxpayers"). Is immediately corrected.
        - He ends up talking about CIP funding during the SSMID talk (like how he was talking DART funding during Parking program)
        - Gatto just makes a bunch of obvious false claims like "this road probably has the most potholes of the whole city"
        - Sheumaker connects SW9th issues to the vision zero plan (bring in to actual reality). Says vision zero should address the issues he is talking about.
        - Gatto rambles so much he begins contradicting himself. Along the lines of "we have so many boarded up buildings and the city doesn't wanna do anything about it... although we did just get a vacant property registration ordinance started..."
- Closing remarks
    - Cownie asks about community input. Sanders shrugs and says "nobody wants to be involved". Note that the city intentionally made the community meetings lowkey, didn't take much input, and didn't use the input they got. Also talk of "activists"  
        - Talk of getting input via neighborhood associations rather than general public
