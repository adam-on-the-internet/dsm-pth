Authorizing issuance of a Notice of Intent to Enter into a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Contract pursuant to Iowa Code Chapter 26A for the City Facility Expansion Phase 1 Improvements and authorization for staff to proceed pursuant to Iowa Code Chapter 26A. 

### Consent Item 11 // Skywalk Improvements

- https://councildocs.dsm.city/communications/2023/23-438.pdf

Approving Professional Services Agreement with RDG Planning & Design for the Skywalk Wayfinding Improvements, not to exceed $146,100. 

### Consent Item 48 // Potential Affordable Housing

- https://councildocs.dsm.city/communications/2023/23-443.pdf

Commitment of $500,000 in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for rehabilitation of the Klein Building at 3614 6th Avenue, resulting in upper-story affordable rental units. 

### Consent Item 53 // Homeland Security Agreement of $500,000

- https://councildocs.dsm.city/communications/2023/23-426.pdf

Agreement with Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management Department (HSEMD) for award of 2023 Cybersecurity Risk Reduction Grand and Memorandum of Agreement with HSEMD for HSEMD to retain such grant for funding for use by the Iowa Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) 

### Item 75 // Council Attendance & Salary

- https://councildocs.dsm.city/resolutions/20231002/75.pdf

Amending Sections 2-62, relating to the salary of the mayor and councilmembers, amending Section 2-112, relating to council attendance, by adding Section 2-113, relating to the determination of sanction and renumbering Section 2-112 to Sec. 2-114.

(A) Final consideration of ordinance above (waiver requested by City Attorney), requires six votes. 

- Seems shoddily written and harshly reactionary to one council member's (Sheumaker) mental health issues & absence. Note that the code carves out
    - absence is voted on by a majority of council, meaning this could easily be leveraged against a minority but not a majority & council would be voting on whether or not given absences were excused
    - absence can be excused if due to "city business" (the mayor's travel absences for his personal political ambitions would likely fall under this exemption)

### Item 77 // 5 Public Speakers
