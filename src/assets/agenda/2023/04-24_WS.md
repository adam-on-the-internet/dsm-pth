        - Masked: Lester
        - Unmasked: Cownie, Boesen, Mandelbaum, Gatto, Sanders, Westergaard, Voss 
- [Audit Review FY 22](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Financial%20Audit%20Report.pdf)
    - Presented by Nikolas Schaul & auditors (RSM)
    - Lots of detail, I'm not including all...
    - couple issues with ARPA fund reporting and inspection timing
- Private Property Hazardous Tree Complaints
    - Sanders briefing council
    - suggesting complaint + inspection + notice
    - this is being requested mainly by Westergaard
    - legal, liability issues
    - as Westergaard describes this, the objective is to help private property owners w/ insurance costs.
        - Seems odd that the city is going to pay to inspect trees on private property for the goal of helping property owners file insurance claims
        - Seems pretty clear that one or a handful of Westergaard's constituents are trying to leverage city resources in neighbor-feuds
        - talk of rentals being different
        - is talk of safety issues for children, but this seems secondary and gets flagged by Sanders because that likely would mean the city would be responsible for inspecting *every* tree in des moines
    - expecting 500-600 per year
    - talk of asking West Des Moines about their program
    - Westergaard also asks about tying it to rental certificate
    - Mandelbaum makes good move of really tying in legal / moral responsibility the city has for rentals. seems to be some agreement across council here.
    - Sanders seems to lose council a bit here. Taken back for further review.
- [Vision Zero Update](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Vision%20Zero.pdf)
    - lots of info, I'm not summing up all (see presentation for more)
    - presenting "Draft Action Plan" that will change
    - talk of public engagement
    - Mandelbaum calls out lack of actionable steps in action plan (ie, "promote safe speeds" rather than specific changes to infrastructure for speed issues)
    - talk of engineering + policing to reduce speeding. talk of speed cameras. "zero tolerance for speeding".
    - comparisons to where they're doing work in Tacouma
    - talk of contract limits, council is surprised "speed management" wasn't part of contract
    - maybe some confusion because Mandelbaum interjected early and rest of council continued with questions
    - arguments between mandelbaum and gatto about Fleur changes.
        - sounds like city staff recommended some safety changes during a recent reconstruction on Fleur but council rejected them, now there's talk of changing Fleur again already...
        - possible context: https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2022/12/19/fatal-alleged-street-racing-crash-on-fleur-drive-leads-to-arrest-des-moines/69741117007/
    - talk of "vision zero" plus "plan dsm", unusual for them to bring these in. some resistance to climate involvement
    - mandelbaum calls for more accessibility, gatto suggests we are doing enough
    - uncomfortable, the presenter has to deal with conflict between Gatto & Mandelbaum
    - noted that most of the complaints come from neighborhoods, but that's not where serious crashes happen
        - need to point focus at the problem, not necessarily complaints
        - "fatal and severe injury"
    - Voss keeps being surprised their contract didn't cover certain details
    - Boesen doing surprisingly decent job at wrangling council comments
    - work with transportation safety committee
    - reading between the lines, it seems pretty clear that the city went cheap with the contracting for Vision Zero and is now frustrated they didn't get more. council should put more money toward vision zero.
    - lot of circular talk
    - part of this is tied to a grant for "safe streets" council is seeking. contractor gives an option of delaying til next year (not good)
    - also tied to "move DSM"
    - very odd that Cownie is so quiet. as mayor, and as someone who has been with the city for so long.
    - Sanders cuts comments short
    - just so much confusion across council & contractor...
    - Nationwide Insurance served on their Vision Zero working group
    - Mandelbaum wants to ramp up goals to 2035. gets pushback from rest of city.
        - some conflict with State Highways, this makes goals more difficult. 
    - Voss: apparently dsm streect collective got left out (and others...)
    - Sanders cuts presentation about 1:37:00
    - Gatto "confused" (doesn't like it) that we may redo existing projects with safety features
    - timeline continues
    - resolution adoption planned for June 26
    - talk of "safe streets for all" grant
- Recycle Donation Bins
    - rescheduled for later - seemingly due to time
