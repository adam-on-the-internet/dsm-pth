## Notes

- Odd timing. No time provided, just "after Special Council Meeting"
- [CIP Update](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/CIP%20Update.pdf)
    - Presented by Steve Nabor (City Engineer)
    - [Projects Map](https://maps.dsm.city/projects/)
    - We inspect every bridge every 2 years
    - Discussion of Walnut Street Bridge, some talk about replacing it with a non-car bridge. Mandelbaum pushing for an alternative, hoping to save money. Voss also sympathetic, points out most cities don't have a bridge every block. 
    - Discussion on Fleur Reconstruction
    - Discussion on Ingersoll Avenue. Gatto against the new Ingersoll vision. Boesen and Cownie seem to agree, make odd comments as if they weren't consulted about this. They approved it! Also- Cownie speaks for Ingersoll business owners- he is one (cownie furs). Talk of lack of parking on Ingersoll- but people who own lots tow people constantly (Mandelbaum points this out, specifically cites crow tow) 
    - [Westergaard defense of Crow Tow](https://youtu.be/7qyvopO2ETs?t=2855). Libertarian "personal property rights" gambit again
    - Gatto says he "isn't sure who signed off on" Ingersoll plan. Council did! They voted for it!
    - Lots more projects discussed, I won't cover all here in notes
- [Capital Planning](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Capital%20Planning.pdf)  
    - Presented multiple topics by multiple people, including Nickolas Schaul
    - Sanders directly says the intent of Sales Tax is to reduce Property Tax. Beyond feelings on this sentiment, note that this is the City Manager advocating policy.
    - Talk of being in deficit. Gatto annoyed. Note part of our deficit is rising costs of DMPD.
    - Going to be lots of follow-ups with small groups (not public)
