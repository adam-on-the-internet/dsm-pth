- [Court Avenue Study by Responsible Hospitality Institute (RHI)](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/RHI%20Sociable%20City%20Assessment.pdf)
    - Presented by Matt Anderson Deputy City Manager and Alicia with RHI
    - some more about RHI:

    - Study originally opened for Court Ave issues, broadened to DSM's "nighttime economy"
    - Lots of recommendations, some short- medium- and long- term
    - Study funded/coordinated by: City of Des Moines, Polk County Board of Supervisors, Operation Downtown, and Greater Des Moines Partnership
    - Scope:
        - Primary Focus - Historic Court District
        - Actions that have systemic challenges may benefit - East Village, other social clusters citywide
    - 4 visits between July-November 2022
    - 40 meetings total (virtual & on-site)
    - Included two police ride-alongs (presenter thanks chief Wingert)
    - Night Manager / Night Mayor recommended strongly. Under City Manager possibly.
    - Presenter points out DMPD is currently doing a lot of things that are technically the responsibilities of other departments, says others should be filling those roles.
    - Lots of more detail in presentation
    - Revive "Nightlife Association" that used to exist
    - Questions around number of bars in one building, especially with single entrance (referring mainly to court center complex)
    - Mention of businesses that had serious violations but were still allowed to operate (I'd also note that the consequences have been arbtirary, harsher for Black owned bars)
    - Presenter makes comments against Alcohol licenses being on Consent Agenda.
    - Gatto raises important points about the legal limits the city is already facing in Iowa with regulating businesses
    - Gatto is against Night Manager being a City Employee, wants public/private partnership (ew)
    - Some questions about Iowa legality seem partially answered by Iowa City's efforts in the same space. Mandelbaum directly raises this point.
    - Lots of talk of relationship between venues and police, I'd note that DMPD raided a gay bar in 2020
    - Lots of talk of "mobility" issues (getting home safely after bars). This is immediately tied to ride-share apps, instead of something like public transit.
    - Clear that DMPD is heavily involved.
    - Mandelbaum calls out that Court Ave isn't just for entertainment, its a neighborhood and people live there (the report largely ommitted this)
    - Gatto again hard on the negative, only thinking about bringing a hammer to this problem (mainly police)
