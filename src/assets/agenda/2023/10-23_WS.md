## Notes

- Intro
    - Run by city manager
- [Des Moines Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) Update](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/MPO%20Update.pdf)
    - MPO is "federally required" in urban areas of a certain population to plan transport
    - Lots of detail in presentation, leaving most out of notes
- [Local Option Sales and Service Tax (LOSST) Annual Report](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/FY2023%20Local%20Option%20Sales%20and%20Services%20Tax%20Expediture%20Report.pdf)
    - Components include: Property Tax Relief, Neighborhood Finance Corp, Debt Avoidance (1200 Locust)
    - Lots of detail in presentation, leaving most out of notes
    - Includes Neighborhood Association Grants $47,475
    - Gatto repeats a complaint some of council has had against Sanders for some time, that some fire equipment is "unstaffed" at times. Sanders is consistent that they intentionally have additional/surplus equipment beyond staff. Related to issues with hiring in the past where council came down hard on Sanders
    - Mention of equipment like Police Body-Worn Cameras (bodycams)
    - Sanders has a refrain about how much he loves the Local Option Sales Tax
    - Gatto says its good to be "transparent". True, but he's talking here about openly bragging about successes, which isn't necessarily bad but isn't really transparency, its PR
- [Budget Calendar](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2023/Council%20Budget%20Calendar.pdf)
    - State requirements changed, additional hearing required and involves sending detailed information to property owners... issues with timeline and any potential delays
    - Cownie cracks a joke to Sanders about whether the State is planning on reimbursing Des Moines for all the streets etc since we're the capitol
    - Westergaard raises concerns about timing and people's availability to attend presentations/Q&A
    - Question over 1 full day of budget talk vs multiple partial days
    - Concerns from Boesen and others that the state's new timeline seems infeasible (for many groups, not just the city)
    - Lots of extra info from city staff about the state stuff
    - one example given is shifting around public safety funding...
    - Cownie goes on odd rant against the state that the state needs "education" about city governance. I don't think that's the issue.
        - "I just wish there was some way we could have a reasonable discussion" with the Iowa GOP. "We function in a very nonpartisan way" - Cownie
