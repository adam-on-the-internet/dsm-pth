    - June 2018 storm led to this masterplan. Sanders says "council was quick to act" on this, but through Register articles it looks like this came from community members pushing city council. That's all fine and good, but worth noting that Sanders leaves the community aspect out of the story. (he does the same with the dmpd third party review story)
