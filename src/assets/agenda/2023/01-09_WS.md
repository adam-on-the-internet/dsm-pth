    - Grass & Weed Enforcement
    - Update to come during Quarterly Work Session
    - wants to add more enforcement for neighborhood inspection
        - is this more policing?
    - "front yards only"... which makes this about aesthetics
        - stated primary goal is "safe and secure rental housing"
        - potential for back yards too. talking w/ legal
    - would likely be a new city contract
    - interesting talk between city, county, state agreements
    - there may be an arrangement for help with mowing, seems to be nonprofits targetted at seniors
- [Budget Timeline Update](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2022/Budget%20FY24%20Calendar.pdf)
    - Budget timeline is shifting around. Councillors can't seem to make time for the budget meetings. Lack of urgency/priority.
