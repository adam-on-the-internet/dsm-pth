    - City Manager Sanders opens with speech, says there was a lot of "public input" with 21cp
    - 21cp has 46 recommendations
    - City Manager Sanders lies and says this was Boesen's idea and voluntary (this was demanded by many racial justice groups for a long time)
    - Sanders hardly mentions that there was already a previous review (Public Works LLC)
    - This report seems to have been pushed to after the election (this is the first work session since the election, the report was supposed to be in around August)
    - Sanders clearly had his hands in this process heavily
    - Sanders says the report will be made public as of this meeting. Worth noting, I had FOIA'd for it the previous week (when the city clearly had it) but the city withheld it til after this meeting
    - 3 of the consultants presenting, 8 of the consultants were involved
    - consultants are all virtual, quality is ridiculously bad
    - Main presenter from 21cp is a former cop, from Tuscon
    - 21cp formed in 2016
    - in background section, 21cp uses the phrase "officer-involved shooting"
    - 21cp goes on long ramble about how we need more cops, ridiculous lol. they talk #s without actually giving examples of current problems. 21cp refuses to engage by talking ratio of residents : police when mandelbaum asks.
    - Mandelbaum gives example that civilian personnel could takeover things like Parking Enforcement and give Sworn Officers time for other things
    - Mandelbaum asks 21cp about staffing... Sanders jumps in to speak for the consultant. Weird! Why can't they answer, and why is Sanders filling in?
    - Gatto asks if we're at "authorized" staffing/strength. Sanders responds that with the next recruitment they will be at "full authorized strength plus a few more" [clip](https://youtu.be/Fw1pRvwFI94?t=2951)
    - Gatto makes an odd statement that the election showed we need to hire more cops (this was not on the ballot)
    - The phrase "community policing" is repeatedly used without definition given
    - 3 hires for data already
    - Gatto wants to hire hire hire more cops, 21cp & others are saying we should be more efficient with what we have (with data, moving some tasks to civilians, etc) first
    - 21cp says the council should implement the Public Works recommendations [clips](https://youtu.be/Fw1pRvwFI94?t=4121)
    - Sanders says he & the city agree that the public should be given more policing data transparently [clip](https://youtu.be/Fw1pRvwFI94?t=4238)
        - Sanders also says he agrees police aren't always the answer, sometimes the city should be using others (civilians) to solve problems, says sometimes "the presence of police" is the wrong approach
    -  21cp says dmpd has an excellent PIO (Parizek) who is "loved" by the department and community. (Parizek is horrible and withholds information illegally, to the point of being penalized in court)
    - Mandelbaum asks about recommendation 10 and unclear language, 21cp seems to have not have their own recommendations ready. awkward moment.
    - Chris Coleman speaks for the first time since returing to council [clip](https://youtu.be/Fw1pRvwFI94?t=4915)
        - Makes odd comment that this isn't about policing, its about council, and police can't do things differently until council does... kinda correct but odd comment
        - says report is a "compliment to the leadership of our police department"
        - calls for third party review of other departments like City Manager (actually an interesting idea)
    - Cownie thanks the community for "pressing" and the council for "listening" and "responding"... interesting way of putting it
    - 21cp and others keep saying the fact that DMPD allowed this report means they are willing to improve voluntarily... as if this report wasn't demanded by residents (clearly there is an attempt to reframe this from community demand to DMPD offer)
