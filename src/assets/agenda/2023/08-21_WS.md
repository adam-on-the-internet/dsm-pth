## Notes

- Reflect DSM (Historic Preservation Plan)
    - Presented by Jason Van Essen, Planning and Urban Design Administrator. 
    - Updating Preservation plan, first plan written in 1995
    - Calling for "broader" view of history, talk of "intangible" history
    - Previously, community meetings were held, some "innovative", from around May 2022 - September 2023
    - Internal "equity audit" done, land acknowledgement. Odd to have "equity" specifically being brought up in historic preservation, which in Des Moines has been a racist / classist effort.
        - On a basic level, it seems that the focus was to include some pages up front about "equity" rather than to create an equitable plan.
    - Westergaard is big mad she wasn't given power here
        - Westergaard specifically mentions history of redlining in Des Moines, which she previously said didn't happen [clip](https://youtu.be/BqHvGUXQW1M?t=1175)
        - Appears like she's making trying to convince people she isn't racist because people know she is racist
        - Odd spat between Westergaard and Sanders over steel curbs. Westergaard is mad they were taken out, Sanders says the neighbors wanted them gone. Then Voss explicity mentions a specific person who wanted the city to give them to him for his backyard so this may just be a specific person trying to get council members to give him the curbs.

    - Overall, weird conversation and weird project.
- Youth Advisory Board (YAB) Update 
    - Presented by the YAB
    - Lots of good talk and presentation
    - Held community conversations
    - Talk of juvenille justice system
    - Note they called for more community fridges (the city previously targeted community fridges for zoning enforcement)
