## Notes

- Intro
    - Present: Boesen, Mandelbaum (left partway thru), Gatto, Sanders, Cownie, Lester, Westergaard, Voss. None masked.
    - At end of meeting, partly off mic, council / sanders discuss the next days work session. some confusion over what is being covered (it isn't on agenda)
- Recycle Donation Bins
    - City Staff requesting "narrow" requirements
    - Odd how detailed / complicated this process is considering other cities have standards. Not sure why council is so divided / confused.
    - Westergaard really railing against resale (vs recycle)
    - Sidenote, the discussion here mirrors some of the talk around community fridges
    - Westergaard calls visible recycling bins a detriment to the neighborhood. wants just clothing, in back, "if we even allow that"
    - Much of this fight seems guided by Westergaard
    - Mandelbaum and Gatto seem to both support the recycle bins
    - Choosing Option A (Westergaard seems to dissent). Option A seems to be lightest restriction
- Addressing Policy 
    - Issues with addresses for new properties and addresses to fix
    - Sanders says this needs to be in policy rather than ad-hoc
    - Goes with zoning enforcement officer
    - Some technical details about how addressing works (cross city, post office, etc)
- Presentations not provided online w/ agenda
