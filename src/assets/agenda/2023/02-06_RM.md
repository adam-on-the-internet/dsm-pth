    - Vote taken by the Mayor without council discussion. Likely intentional to silence nuanced comments from Sheumaker and Mandelbaum.
        - Cownie: "Great comments, anybody have a motion?"
        - Boesen: "I'll move"
        - Gatto: "I'll second"
    - DM Partnership allies allowed to talk over their time limit
    - More speakers in audience wanted to speak, the Mayor immediately called for a vote without checking for more speakers once the allies had spoken
    - Likely a violation of state law around public hearings to close out hearing early arbitrarily (though this is unenforced). 
- Git-N-No finally cleared (item #46)
