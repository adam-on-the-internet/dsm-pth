    - Climate Action Plan
    - [Related Comments](https://x.com/cl4dsm/status/1721533500766015652?s=20)
    - Long project timeline, started May-August '22
    - Talk of broad community engagement
    - Voss asks if MidAm had a representative on the steering committee
    - This whole plan is based on goals set by council previously
    - Lots of good detail in presentation, I won't try to type it all out here.
    - Climate pollution reduction goals:
        - 2025: 28% Reduction in emissions from 2008 levels
        - 2030: 45% Reduction in emissions from 2010 levels
        - 2035: 100% 24/7 Carbon-Free electricity citywide
        - 2050: Net-Zero greenhouse gas emissions
    - Mention of MidAm's coal plants
    - Gatto combative to city staff, says plan is "telling MidAmerican how to run their business"
    - Gatto claims only a tiny portion of residents want this plan (that was passed previously...) and quibbles with things MidAm already agreed to
    - Westergaard claims to staff that the "real" stakeholders, developers, are missing from those reached out too. Also mad that MidAmerican isn't doing the present of the City's plan (???)
    - Staff reports that MidAm has been cooperative in the process of the plan. Odd then, that council members are making vague complaints and attacks on behalf of MidAmerican now.
    - Staff reports that Homeowners will be the group that incurs most of the cost over time (not developers). The plan is explicitly designed to *reduce* energy costs over time. (MidAm and others like to pretend it will raise costs w/o any explanation)
    - Westergaard says she thinks the document is huge and that she "I can't imagine that anyone has actually read every word of it"... odd thing for Westergaard to say, just saying she's too lazy to read the plan council requested? Westergaard repeatedly comes to meetings uninformed and then complains to staff and others that she is confused.
    - Staff directly states that incremental changes won't meet the goals council has set
    - Note... the complaints are annoying but its a good sign that Gatto/Westergaard are actually worried about this. Means it probably isn't a weak plan.
    - Boesen makes the point that approving this plan opens the door to more funds and grants. (Presumably, the city will be shown to be eager and ready for major grants around these climate initiatives.)
    - Regional plan that is similar is in the works.
    - Grants worth billions are in the talks (DSM would only get part of that)
    - Point repeatedly made that up-front costs will be a little painful, but overtime it'll pay off a lot.
    - Gatto keeps badgering staff about the natural gas goals.
    - "35 target actions" in the near time.
    - Part of the plan's goal is to tie other initiatives to their climate benefits (for instance, filling sidewalk gaps is good for accessibility AND climate)
    - Cownie goes on boring and not productive speech at the end.
    - Currently, seems to just be 2 staffers involved! I'm impressed especially compared to usual.
    - Vote will be on Nov 20.
    - Gatto ends by quibbling over Grants with Match requirements. Sanders has to try to hold him back lol. He asks the same question multiple times.
    - Westergaard ends by quibbling over costs, etc...
    - (note again, these goals were approved by council unanimously)

    - Lots of good detail in presentation, I won't try to type it all out here.
    - 5 year plans & 1 year action plans...
    - Cownie makes odd "nonpartisan" comment, tells story about lobbying Republican Mark Latham (sp?) for funding
