"This proposed change adds trails, land and facilities managed by the department to the list of locations where it is unlawful
to use, possess or consume alcohol and adds Simon Estes Amphitheater to the list of facilities
at which alcohol may be consumed with a permitted reservation. This venue could potentially
reopen in 2024, so this modification will allowed for the type of use anticipated and acceptable
at this location"

- Notable that more areas are going to be "dry" from alcohol, but mainly interesting that the city anticipates the Simon Estes Amphitheater may reopen in 2024.
