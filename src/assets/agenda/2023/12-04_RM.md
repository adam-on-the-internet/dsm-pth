## Notes

- Boesen (mayor pro-tem) presiding because Mayor Cownie is virtual, at Dubai for COP28 conference
- Council Members not speaking clearly into mics throughout meeting
- Room packed for climate action plan (standing room only)
- Discussion on 31 about offstreet parking (and maybe 32)
- Discussion on 33, Syntergy Contractor, possible legal/OSHA issues?
- Odd public business happens off mic, awarding flowers to a city attorney
- ~20 public commentors all spoke in the same direction, broadly & connected with these 3 issues:
    - against the new DMPD station, noting the money can also be better spent elsewhere
    - in favor of funding DART, noting this is somewhere the DMPD funds could go
    - in favor of further climate action, noting how the first two points are directly related to climate as well
- Item 14, DMPD settlement, Mandelbaum speaks about 21cp questioning 2020 protest actions
- Item 18, Mandelbaum speaks, on same line as last meeting about how the city should take further action on development agreements
    - affordability
    - verified payroll
    - Labor
    - Developer holdouts (keeping buildings vacant)
