## Notes

1. ROLL CALL:

2. APPROVING AGENDA, AS PRESENTED AND/OR, AS AMENDED:

3. Directing sale of General Obligation Bonds, Series 2023A.

- Sanders speaks about bids and staff work
- City does these "Wednesday sales" for bonds, they say they get better rates because its an off-day

4. Directing sale of Stormwater Management Utility Revenue Bonds, Series 2023B.

5. Excepting Fiscal Year 2024 from the Cityâ€™s Debt Limit Policy.
(Council Communication No. 23-450)

- City is going past their usual 80% "debt limit" to purchase the Nationwide Building aka 1200 locust
- Note this is in part to get a potential Modern Policing Facility for DMPD
- Sanders off-handedly mentions council making "hard choices" to buy 1200 locust... references tha alternate was building new construction which would be more expensive (this has not been spelled out in total publicly and may reference a new DMPD station) mentions for "past 18 months"
- debt limit is a city policy, not state
- Westergaard says "we aren't growing to the extend that the other suburbs are", seems to see Des Moines as a suburb/competing with suburbs
- all vote Yes (6-0)

6. Approving 5-day Special Class C Liquor License (Beer/Wine) for Thirsty Pigs, 520
Robert D. Ray Drive, for an event on October 5, 2023.

7. MOTION TO ADJOURN.
