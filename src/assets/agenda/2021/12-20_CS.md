## Notes

- This closed session (a non-public meeting) is being held in accordance with Section 21.5, Subsection 1, Paragraph C, of the Iowa Code.
    - [Iowa Code 12.5 Closed session](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code/21.5.pdf)

- Council says this session is closed from the public because they are discussing strategy with counsel concerning litigation,
and that this discussion, if public, would put the City in a disadvantage in that litigation.

- We assume council is discussing one of many lawsuits against the city and its Police Department, but we cannot say for certain.
