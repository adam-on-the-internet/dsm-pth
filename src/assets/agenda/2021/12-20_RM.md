## Hearings

Members of the Public can speak on Hearing Items.

   - **Item #68**: An appeal by Genesis Health Club Sports Complex SE, LLC of a site plan denial, and some followup business.
        - Genesis Health Clubs aims to repurpose old Sears & Roebuck retail space at Southridge Mall into a "state-of-the-art" health club
        - Genesis is requesting that the city waive minimum interior parking lot landscaping standards concerning the "berm frontage buffer requirements" and "tree canopy requirement"
        - Alongside this request, Genesis has agreed to increase the subsidy amounts they provide towards the "costs for children in low to moderate income households to participate in the health club programs" by $125,000 for a new total of $3,075,000
        - This deal is questionable. They are blatantly offering to pay to break city code when the payment & waived requirements may be separate on paper. Also, the "payment" is in funding for their own programs, so the cost estimate is misleading.
