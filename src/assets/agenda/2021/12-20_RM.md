## Notes

There are several items of concern to the community on this week's agenda.
Not only is DSM City Council continuing to hold in person meetings
during a COVID spike, but their most developed plan for confronting the ongoing climate crisis is to focus on whether or 
not we should be feeding wild geese.
Additionally, they refuse to honor accomodation requests by residents, which excludes people with accessibilty or mobility issues.
This infringes on our right to safely assemble and be heard.

Council will be voting on new precinct and ward maps. This should be a process tailored around public input but so far that input has been ignored
in favor of a map that gives councilman Joe Gatto even more influence over city revenue in a ward that he still does not live in.

On the agenda there is also a funding request for Mayor Cownie to attend a mayor's conference in Washington. Why should we be spending taxpayer
money so he can go to a super spreader event that does nothing to improve our material conditions in this city.

Various gentrification efforts on the north, east, and south side as well as the Drake area. A lot of this development relies on PlanDSM funds:

Drake Area: TIF funds are being used to put up loft apartments in the Carpenter Ave / MLK area.

Council will also be discussing funding costs for their public nuisance assessment program.
This program fines property owners for failing to take care of "public nuisance" which is
defined as "an act, condition, or thing that is illegal because it interferes with the rights of the public generally".
This loose definition not only encourages our neighbors to police each other, but it further criminalizes and stigmatizes 
poverty.
When public nuisances persist, it is often because the owner lacks the material resources to take care of it.
Why are we punishing people for this when we can simply pool resources to solve the problem?

## Hearing Items

Members of the Public are only guranteed to be allowed to speak on Hearing Items.

   - **Item #68**: An appeal by Genesis Health Club Sports Complex SE, LLC of a site plan denial, and some followup business.
        - Genesis Health Clubs aims to repurpose old Sears & Roebuck retail space at Southridge Mall into a "state-of-the-art" health club
        - Genesis is requesting that the city waive minimum interior parking lot landscaping standards concerning the "berm frontage buffer requirements" and "tree canopy requirement"
        - Alongside this request, Genesis has agreed to increase the subsidy amounts they provide towards the "costs for children in low to moderate income households to participate in the health club programs" by $125,000 for a new total of $3,075,000
        - This deal is questionable. They are blatantly offering to pay to break city code when the payment & waived requirements may be separate on paper. Also, the "payment" is in funding for their own programs, so the cost estimate is misleading.
