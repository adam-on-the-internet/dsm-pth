# Notes

Council held a Special Meeting on Redistricting. 
They had announced they would be considering a controversial 
map from Polk County, but at the meeting they changed their tune
and claimed that map was never up for consideration.

In the end, they submitted "Map 3", although all members of the public 
but one had spoken in favor of Maps 1 & 2.
