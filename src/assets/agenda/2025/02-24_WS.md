## Notes

- Development Agreements
    - Sanders says this was requested by council
    - discussed with unions
    - mainly around things like misclassified workers, unlicensed workers
    - Sanders cuts off questions from Westergaard who is asking about issues that have happened historically with city projects
    - Gatto doesn't want to use the current law around "responsible bidder" because republicans told him if they do they will retaliate. This amounts to obeying in advance. [clip](https://youtu.be/0B9J5qASc7w?t=1469)
    - details on TIF and development agreement standards
    - the "development community" and lenders don't like this :( so sad
    - staff is pushing council to continue using current development agreement
    - lmao. other councillors are encouraging Mandelbaum to ask their questions for them because he's better at phrasing these things
    - Boesen keeps trying to cut off comments and questions
    - Boesen wants to cut things off againn
    - Westergaard points out they asked for this meeting a year and a half ago, wants to find solutions
    - Council seem to be at different spots here, but a good number of them want some positive change
    - Boesen seems to overrule all the concerns and just move to continue on what staff is currently doing (keep language, meet with MAC regional)
    - Mandelbaum wants at least one small thing, requiring a list of sub contractors
- Vision Zero and Complete Streets
    - This topic got skipped for time
    - Mandelbaum and others recommend meeting extra Mondays to get through topics
