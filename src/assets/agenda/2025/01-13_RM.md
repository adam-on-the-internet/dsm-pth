## Notes

- Council chambers at capacity, overflow room used. Speaker setup for overflow
- now-former mayor Cownie, "climate mayor" attends the meeting as a member of the public seemingly in response to dismantling of sustainability department
- Item 36 on duplex zoning
    - residents really mad about 1 potential duplex in a large lot
    - city passes it anyway
    - Homeowner allowed to speak well over her time (other cut off sharply)
    - woodland heights neighborhood associated opposed
- Hearing Item 38 on pallet shelter
    - this item is in response to backlash to the city's anti-homeless policies
    - some concerns from the public about separating LGBTQ+ and other marginalized populations
    - Coleman makes odd comment that this is part of the city's anti-homeless plan (?)
    - Gatto says this is not really related to anti-homeless plan (?), mentions wrap-around services. Calls this "alternative" to other options.
    - Mandelbaum says this has been in motion for about 1.5 years (but we all know this wasn't really committed to until they tried to ban homelessness)
    - Mandelbaum notes we still need more money for the full support for this solution
    - This item is just for the grant
    - Sanders says we have just a month to find partners to operate this (why can't the city do this?), says we need 3-4 organizations
    - Gatto wants public-private partnership
    - Sanders agrees public-private and wants "significant" contribution
    - Voss says they started talking about this in "late 2022"
- Item 41
    - public notes that this is a good plan and the payment is far under the engineer's estimate, yay!
- Item 49 public speakers
    - Boesen opens saying council should not engage with public during this time
    - after saying council should not respond to public, Sanders gives (pre-written) speech before public speaking (this goes against state law & city rules - the issue Sanders discusses is not on the agenda)
    - public is very against dismantling the sustainability department, no speakers support the dismantling. public is also angry and surprised, even more than usual when they're upset.
    - public notes that ADAPT DSM plan explicitly relies on the Sustainability Office to lead overall coordination of the plan
    - people who were working with the office now don't know where to go, their work was just dropped
    - speaker notes this timing is during the LA Fires
    - speaker connects housing/homelessness to climate, mentioning climate refugees will be moving here more and more
    - speaker notes DMPD takes 40% of the budget, and this sustainability office budget is loose change
    - speaker also notes cost of DMPD lawsuits, including the police murder of Trevontay Jenkins
    - speaker notes that the downtown hy-vee changes lost an accessible entrance, no longer ADA accessible
    - speaker notes that the city's "warming centers" close by nightfall
    - speaker says that she has heard the city is already sending out 72 hour notices to camps, despite claims to the contrary
    - [clip of heated exchange between Boesen and Mandelbaum](https://youtu.be/rr4__Z4DVT4?t=5991)
    - Mandelbaum tries to speak in response to comments, Boesen tries to block but eventually allows due to public outcry
    - Boesen is trying to delay any further conversation on this til February
    - Mandelbaum questions the process that led to this
    - Mandelbaum notes the office was never given time to give a report on their work on council, and is now unable to (this would impact discussion of funding for the office, every other department can present its case)
    - Mandlebaum notes that the office was working on applying for funding with looming deadlines, and that is now dropped. Does Sanders have a plan?
    - Weirdness over closing votes, Boesen can't keep things straight
