## Notes

- Intro
    - Mandelbaum remote
- Update on Housing Strategy 
    - second update
    - city staff is proposing more potential cuts to housing programs to resolve deficit
    - this 14 mill cut seems to be different from the 17 mill shortfall? not clear in the meeting
    - some programs are set to grow
    - the city is proposing to take over homes in some cases
        - Westergaard notes that the people living in these homes probably won't be able to afford repairs or to live elsewhere
        - Sanders claims the ION program will help them. Westergaard laughs at this. [clip](https://youtu.be/S4fKITBuabk?t=2852)
    - lots of notes that the region is going to slow its growth
    - city staff wants to make offers to slowly replace/repair these homes over years
    - Westergaard does not want to displace people, and Sanders is pretending that won't happen
        - Westergaard's concerns are dismissed outright
        - Gets into argument with city staff calling this "scare tactics" [clip](https://youtu.be/S4fKITBuabk?t=4032)
        - Westergaard wants to know how much we paid for the study, concerned with these conversations during budget crunch [clip](https://youtu.be/S4fKITBuabk?t=4770)
    - Coleman also hesitant for this, long reason why involving the budget cycles
        - seems to be against rentals
    - talk of absentee owners milking property
    - Boesen cuts conversation short before council has made a meaningful decision on direction
    - Sanders says this is not an approval, but will lead to further research
