- [Central Iowa Shelter and Services (CISS) Update](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2022/ciss.pdf)
    - Presented by Melissa (O'Neil?)
    - Hypothetical example to start
    - Emergency Shelter, Low-Barrier Shelter
    - Gives brief history of CISS
    - Mentions connection to Primary Healthcare (PHC)
    - Melissa claims they never had a COVID-19 outbreak in the shelter

    - Melissa claims CISS is "open to everybody"

    - Council Member Mandelbaum raises concern that CISS residency has dropped as unsheltered rate has increased.
        - Is told by Melissa this is partially due to masking w/ COVID. That doesn't seem to line up timewise, and the shelter has masking due to strep & flu, not just COVID
        - Council Member Sheumaker also raises similar point
        - Main flag: number of people in CISS is lower than history, but unsheltered is higher than history, why?
        - Melissa keeps being defensive and offering excuses rather than discussing the point
        - Council Member Sheumaker asks if Melissa & CISS are open to change (in part in response to ongoing study)
        - Melissa gives murky answer about "incremental" change

    - three Metro communities do not contribute financially [clip](https://youtu.be/GpOTNLUvEvE?t=3096)
        - Ankeny, Johnston, Urbandale
        - it is brought up that police from other cities drop unsheltered people at CISS
    - Goal of stay in 14 days, average is 29.42, 90 day length (max?) "but most are out before then anyway"

            - Sheumaker suggests that if neighborhood meetings do happen, they should be public meetings so that any/all council members can attend
            - Boesen rebuts, saying she doesn't feel they need to be official public meetings (this violates Iowa open meetings law)
            - City Attorney Jeff Lester says that if the councillors are truly "listening only" and not talking at all, they don't have to be public meetings.

            - conversation trails off after Westergaard simply suggests printing off county website pages instead... odd.
