    - Presented by Melissa (O'Neil?)
    - Hypothetical example to start
    - Emergency Shelter, Low-Barrier Shelter
    - Gives brief history of CISS
    - Mentions connection to Primary Healthcare (PHC)
    - Melissa claims they never had a COVID-19 outbreak in the shelter
    - Melissa claims many people prefer chairs, so many people sleep in chairs rather than beds
    - Melissa says they used to hire an "off duty officer" for overnight. used officer to establish "relationships"
    - Melissa claims CISS is "open to everybody"
    - Melissa uses term "transgendered" and is corrected by Council Member Sheumaker
    - Council Member Mandelbaum raises concern that CISS residency has dropped as unsheltered rate has increased.
        - Is told by Melissa this is partially due to masking w/ COVID. That doesn't seem to line up timewise, and the shelter has masking due to strep & flu, not just COVID
        - Council Member Sheumaker also raises similar point
        - Main flag: number of people in CISS is lower than history, but unsheltered is higher than history, why?
        - Melissa keeps being defensive and offering excuses rather than discussing the point
        - Council Member Sheumaker asks if Melissa & CISS are open to change (in part in response to ongoing study)
        - Melissa gives murky answer about "incremental" change
        - Gatto picks fight with Council Member Sheumaker [approximate clip](https://youtu.be/GpOTNLUvEvE?t=2672)
    - CISS also gets funding from state, other cities, counties, etc
    - city of Newton is brought up as a partner around 50:00 (along with other cities)
    - three Metro communities do not contribute financially [clip](https://youtu.be/GpOTNLUvEvE?t=3096)
        - Ankeny, Johnston, Urbandale
        - it is brought up that police from other cities drop unsheltered people at CISS
    - Goal of stay in 14 days, average is 29.42, 90 day length (max?) "but most are out before then anyway"
