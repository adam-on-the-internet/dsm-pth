    - Presented by SuAnn Donovan and RK & Associates (Suresh Arwani)
    - Significant Odor Generators
        - Darling Ingredients Rendering Plant
        - Pine Ridge Farms - Pork Packing Plant
        - Wiechman Pig Company - Swine buying station
    - Current process activates when there are 10 calls to odor hotline with same descriptor within 6 hours
        - if 3 findings in 90-day period, company must have a mitigation plan (this has never happened)
    - Odd how much this focuses on "odor" when odor is a sign of broader air pollution
        - Pollutants are dealt with my County & State
    - Council bought an odor study by RK & Associates
    - Currently receive around 200 smell complaints per year
    - Westergaard eager to visit factories and defend them
        - she calls the odors "the smell of money" in a previous meeting
    - Last time it was really looked over was 20 years ago
    - Already talking about potential of studies being "there's nothing we can do, but we can have an explanation"
    - Lot of talk about nuisance lawsuits (expensive)
    - RKA works for the industry often and says that the proposed plan would protect the industry from class action
        - the short explanation: the city can setup a high-bar "nuisance" problem that nobody fits, then legally industry can say they are "not a nuisance" because they don't fit the city's ridiculous definition
- closed session at 3pm
