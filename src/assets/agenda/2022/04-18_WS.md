    - Presented by City Architect Anne Munson.
    - Consultants got a LOT of community input.
- [Neighborhood Toolkit](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2022/Neighborhood%20Toolkit.pdf?pdf=Neighborhood%20Toolkit&t=1650048334927)
    - Presented by Heather Tamminga, Neighborhood Outreach Coordinator.
    - An overview with recommendations for the Neighborhood Association Toolkit.
    - There is a strange "independence" for Neighborhood Associations. It isn't clear to me where the line is and it doesn't seem to be clear to Council Members either.

    - Presented by SuAnn Donovan
    - Current zoning allows "85 dBC eight times a month", this was apparently an "accident" or "unintendid loophole"
    - Potential buyers of the old Social Club building want to be able to use amplified sound for events in their courtyard. They are facing opposition from nearby home-owners.
    - DMPD did a sound study of the area, which an officer (Stroope?) presented
    - Someone speaking from the public on behalf of home owners was allowed to address council during this Work Session, which is rarely allowed
    - Council seems to be primarily seeking a heavy comprimise to alleviate the home-owners who live near this outdoor venue.
    - Councillor Mandelbaum was leading the conversation, only Councillor Sheumaker seemed to provide a statement of her stance on the issue.
    - There is concern that if future owners of this venue can not use it for events, nobody would want to buy it.
