    - Mandelbaum and Sheumaker begin by refusing to rush item 71 until lead service lines are in place
        - in short, Mandelbaum wants to require lead pipe testing certain units for rental certificates
    - City Manager Sanders is continually delaying lead service line testing
        - He is publicly lobbying against this, against his position
        - Sanders says they can bring this back immediately in January, but this is contradicted throughout [clip](https://youtu.be/MZcNoUFdKfk?t=3646)
        - Lot of talking that sounds like "if we test we will find a problem, so we don't want to test"
    - Mandelbaum asked about this in previous work session, others are pretending that didn't happen
    - Westergaard and Gatto speak against testing & removal of lead pipes
    - Mandelbaum secures some "verbal commitment" then gives up
    - Lots of side conversations between Sanders, Cownie, and others
    - Cownie blocks Sheumaker from asking questions
    - Voss interrupts Sheumaker w/ attempt at vote [clip](https://youtu.be/MZcNoUFdKfk?t=4248)
    - Westergaard says "they're gonna have lead pipes" about renters who currently have lead pipes [clip](https://youtu.be/MZcNoUFdKfk?t=4548)
    - Near vote, Westergaard says, while Sheumaker is talking, that she believes testing for lead pipes in rentals may violate personal property rights "we can't get into personal property rights" (?) [clip](https://youtu.be/MZcNoUFdKfk?t=4462)
