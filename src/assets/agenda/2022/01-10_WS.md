## Notes

### Vacant Building Registration

Some council members what a "vacant building registration ordinance". 
This ordinance would develop a system for registering and monitoring vacant properties in Des Moines.

The City cites the following reasons for this ordinance:

- protect property values
- shift burden of monitoring properties from city to property owner
- decrease "crime"

This will likely come before council is the first quarter of 2022.

### Rental Code Amendments

#### Nuclear Family Exemption

- Staff had suggested eliminated the "nuclear family exemption" for 
property owners. This exemption means that an owner
does not need a rental license if the house is occupied by 
parents or children.
- Staff changed their minds, and now support the exemption.
- This is now being studied in relation to "AHU" structures.

#### Separation of Shared Forced Air Furnace Units

- Elimination of shared air from forced air heating units was 
considered, but council wanted more information.
- Staff recommends the code by amended to eliminate shared forced air
furnace units due to:
    - international mechnical code
    - health risks
    - fire safety
    - energy efficiency
