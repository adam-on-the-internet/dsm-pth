## Notes

- Mosquito Control
    - discussing what the city does for Mosquito Control
    - city staff looking for whether to continue the program, and how to run it (internal vs contract)
    - Gatto throws odd tantrum about this being discussed, doesn't even want the option to stop the program
    - Mandelbaum is interested in stopping the program and mentions that residents have said they want it to stop
    - Research shows that mosquito-control insecticides have negative impacts, including declines to native pollinators
