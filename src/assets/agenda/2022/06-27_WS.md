## Notes

- Council Member Gatto is presiding. Lots of absence.
    - Only Voss, Westergaard, and Gatto are present. Not sure if others are online.
        - Mandelbaum shows up late and then presides. Mayor Cownie is on the phone.
- Presented by John Davis, City Traffic Engineer, and others
    - Tool Design Group
- Good stuff from Vision Zero and Council, but Council dwells a lot on drag racing. Many of these concerns are about noise, not safety.
- No mention of vehicles driving into protests
- Gatto doesn't want to aim for zero deaths, Westergaard has different arguments but also argues against.
- A LOT of cross talk around 44:00
- Westergaard blames school for not communicating with the City for student traffic death [clip](https://youtu.be/oi8fB8l8sUA?t=3270)
- Voss of cousre brings up bicycles
- Westergaard complains that there was not enough outreach about public meeting about Vision Zero
