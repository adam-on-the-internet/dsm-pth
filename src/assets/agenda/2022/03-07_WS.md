- First meeting without mask policy in public buildings. Gatto, Sanders, Boesen, Voss, and Westergaard were maskless at the start of the meeting. Westergaard put on a mask during the meeting.
- Majority of Council Members are wearing masks, but the City Manager doesn't.

### Stream Buffer

The City is moving forward on Stream Buffer protections.

- ["25 years ago, nobody ever imagined that there would be the erosion that's there today" - Linda Westergaard](https://youtu.be/_xJwfT32psw?t=1827)
- Lots of private conversations among Council Members and the City Manager.
- Some contradictions in what Council says here. Sometimes saying the homeowners pay the burden of these issues, other times talking about City projects created for these issues.

### Procurement

Changes are coming to the Procurement process. An ordinance will be proposed shortly.

- ["There's only one train of thought when it comes to people that are paying taxes." - Linda Westergaard](https://youtu.be/_xJwfT32psw?t=4501)
