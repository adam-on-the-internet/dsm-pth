### Notes

- Lots of more developer planning talk.
- Council Member Westergaard is remote, a number of technical difficulties (which are unfortunate to be experiencing 2 years into a pandemic).
- Lots of questions came up about the HUD ARPA allocation plan.
- Council Members Gatto & Voss were not masked.
- Accessory Housing Units discussed, some arguments from Gatto & Westergaard.
- Hearing on Police Station was shortened to two speakers.
- Lauridsen noise limits introduced, but voted down after folks from Lauridsen explained that it would cancel scheduled concerts and that they hadn't been contacted until that day (by a reporter).
    - On the Lauridsen item, Council Member Mandelbaum failed to get a second. Council did not know how to handle this, even though they had handled Sheumaker not getting seconds regularly.
- Immediately after meeting, two female DMPD officers came into the room (this was unusual) and stuck around.
