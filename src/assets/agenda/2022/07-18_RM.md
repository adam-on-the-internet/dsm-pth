[Resolution](https://councildocs.dsm.city/resolutions/20220718/59.pdf)

This agenda item, which required a Hearing, did not disclose that the purchases of 3 vehicles
were for the Police Department.

A member of the public questioned what these cars would be used for (since the agenda and attachments did not disclose)
and council members attempted to not answer the question or answer in private after the meeting.
The City Manager claimed there were too many vehicles being purchased so he didn't know which were
being asked about (the Hearing item only involved 3 vehicles).

A member of City Staff then came out and answered that these vehicles were indeed Police Vehicles.
At this point, the required Public Hearing had already ended.
