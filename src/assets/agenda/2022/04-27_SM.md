## Notes

- Mayor Cownie is absent, Councillor Mandelbaum is running the meeting (as mayor pro-tem)
- Main items, setting date for hearings (5/9/22) concerning a 13-year franchise agreement contract with Mid-American.
    - Holding this item as a special meeting (out of routine meetings) is a way to rush the timeline for the agreement, and to advance the agreement outside of the standard procedure of council.
    - Concerns 1 "main" agreement and 1 "side" agreement
    - Councillor Gatto specifically tried to rush this item (cutting off discussion by Mandelbaum)
    - There is a conversation between Councillor Mandelbaum and City Manager Scott Sanders about MidAmerican's agreements and their position on aligning with the city's climate goals. (The City Manager is in charge of the negotiations.)
