## Notes

- Geographical Information Systems (GIS) Downtown Digital Model (IT/maps)
    - Presented by Erin-Olson Douglas (development services director)
    - This discussion was driven in part by a call to change building height requirements for the "market district" area
    - Tall buildings in the "market district" area would potentially block views of the Iowa Capital Building from places like Principal Park
    - GIS getting 3-dimensional models would allow for better planning of the views from certain buildings
    - 3d GIS Live Demonstration of Model given during presentation
    - Part of the plan is to model buildings before they're built, so they can be viewed within the city's model
