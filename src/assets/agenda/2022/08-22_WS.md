## Notes

- Geographical Information Systems (GIS) Downtown Digital Model (IT/maps)
    - Presented by Erin-Olson Douglas (development services director)
    - This discussion was driven in part by a call to change building height requirements for the "market district" area
    - Tall buildings in the "market district" area would potentially block views of the Iowa Capital Building from places like Principal Park
    - GIS getting 3-dimensional models would allow for better planning of the views from certain buildings
    - 3d GIS Live Demonstration of Model given during presentation
    - Part of the plan is to model buildings before they're built, so they can be viewed within the city's model
- Property Nuisance Process
    - Presented by SuAnn Donovan (Deputy Zoning Enforcement Officer)
    - Detailed discussion of property nuisance process
    - "Landbanking" is brought up as a future project, but "its a budget issue". Seems to have some council support.
    - Councillor Sheumaker brings up idea that the city should assist with housing folks who are displaced by this process. Cites at least one person who is in this situation.
    - City has historically only used complaints and fire reports to work on "public nuisances". Now, it may begin happening "proactively"
    - Mayor Cownie brings up diatribe about how unhoused people living in vacant homes is a "public safety issue", insisting that these houses should be torn down
