## Notes

- MidAmerican Energy check presentation to start (?)
    - MidAmerican (w/ Ken Setzkorn) presents check to Mandelbaum
    - About a municipal services building that is saving money on energy
    - not a real check... bizarre. its a check of "partnering together". symbolic of the city's "partnership" w/ midamerican
    - city is giving time for MidAmerican PR. odd.
    - Saving "$145,000 a year" by engaging with midam's energy savings program
- Meeting fairly empty
- Both entrances open
- Cownie absent (in Egypt) so pro-temp Mandelbaum ran meeting
- Mandelbaum, Sheumaker, Lester masked
- Lots of discussion on church item #42. City & applicant denied complaints had been received, but they are documented.
- Discussion around #43 where affordable housing money is being spent on things like junk/debris enforcement. Sheumaker wants change. Sanders lobbies against.
- consent agenda notes:
    - 28 NO sheumaker
