    - Preented by Steven Naber, Cory Boganry (sp?) city traffic engineer
    - Connect Downtown started as the Downtown Walkability Study in 2016
    - Council Members bring up a handful of targetting problem spots (mainly on University Avenue)
    - Bit of clashing between Gatto & Mandelbaum
    - Gatto wants focus to be on non-downtown corridors
    - Mandelbaum wants focus on downtown
    - Westergaard calls directly for "re-evaluating plan" to move focus to Ward 2
    - A bit of negativitiy is being pushed on Mandelbaum now because he is the sole council member in charge of downtown (after redistricting). Concerns about this were brought up during redistricting but summarily dismissed.
    - A bit of talk about how this involves TIF funding
    - A bit of talk about bike connections
    - Odd comment from Westergaard about MidAmerican franchise agreement [here](https://youtu.be/0SXGD4xTzVE?t=5540)
