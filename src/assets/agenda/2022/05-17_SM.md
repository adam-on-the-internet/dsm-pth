## Topics

- Rushed 2nd readings for MidAmerican Franchise Agreement
- First Consideration of Ordinance for noise at 900 Mulberry (old social club)

## Overview

- This meeting was scheduled for the same time as a pre-established Work Session, making it unclear which order they would actually happen in.
- This meeting happened FIRST (before Work Session)

## Notes

- Mayor Cownie is back from Sweden and opens with a speech (not on the agenda) about the "global issues" around climate change, appreciates the "passion" of speakers against MidAmerican
    - Says we can't do things at the local level, we need to work with "other levels" (county, state, national), even while voting on something that could make an impact at the local level
    - Note: Cownie went to a conference of local politicians who are "passionate" about climate change and his takeaway was that we can't do things on the local level
    - Also notes the virtual accessibility for the conference
    - Cownie calls for an update on what Des Moines is doing from City Staff
- Mayor Cownie (who runs the meetings) was unsure if the Special Meeting or Work Session would happen first and had to ask City Manager Sanders

    - No discussion
    - Vote: 5-1-1 (Sheumaker NO, Mandelbaum RECUSE)
- Item #4, MidAm Gas Franchise Agreement, 2nd Reading

- Item #5, on sound ordinance restrictions for 900 Mulberry Street (old Social Club site)
    - Reducing the events requested by 1/3 and limiting events to 90dbc
    - Not allowing Concert Venue, amplified sound will not be the "primary purpose" of events
    - Adjusting ordinance for "ambiguity"
