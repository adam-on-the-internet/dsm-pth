    - Presented by Greg Edwards

    - Council Member Mandelbaum brings up the bills brought by Iowa GOP (specifically targetting transgender students) in terms of how it impacts travel to Iowa
    - Talk about a lot of big events like Dew Tour
    - Gatto requests events at new constructions like the private Genesis Health Club
    - Greg Edwards says they floated the idea of giving out "incentives" to keep the Iowa Caucus first in the nation
        - [Caucus discussion](https://youtu.be/Uts9cq3ZiBY?t=2891)
        - [Caucus discussion - incentives](https://youtu.be/Uts9cq3ZiBY?t=2917)
- [Current Parking Progress](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2022/2022%20%20Parking%20Regulations%20-%204-27-2022%20Council%20Workshop.pdf?pdf=Current%20Parking&t=1651011288524)
    - Presented by Michael Ludwig & Matt Anderson
    - Talk of parking minimums/maximums and parking "demand" versus "perception"
    - Parking minimums were lowered in 2019
    - Council is "split" on eliminating parking minimums, also talk of establishing maximums
    - Talk on "retroactive" handling of surface parking lots as future redevelopment opportunities
- [Plan DSM Progress](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2022/PlanDSM%20Implementation.pdf?pdf=Plan%20DSM%20Progress&t=1651011288524)
    - Presented by Michael Ludwig
    - Lots of celebration on progress & plan in general
    - Interesting comment from City Manager Scott Sanders about "governance, generally" [here](https://youtu.be/Uts9cq3ZiBY?t=7344)
- [DART Art](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2022/CityCouncilWorkSession_Avenues_DARTArt.pdf?pdf=Dart%20Art&t=1651011288524)
    - Presented by Lauren Collock (sp?) and Matt Harris (sp?)
    - Talk of bus shelters with public art
    - Councillor Linda raised concerns to the presenters about issues in her neighborhood's bus stops (including snow removal and grass cutting)
- [Law Enforcement Data Report](https://cms2files.revize.com/desmoines/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2022/LTDM%20CC%20LE%20Code%20Data%20Presentation%20FINAL%20APR%2026.pdf)
    - Presented by Public Works, LLC (Eric, Linda Rhodes, others, mostly remote)
    - [Law Enforcement Report](https://dsm-document-archive.netlify.app/assets/doc-archive/law_enforcement_report_04-21-22.pdf)
    - [Code Enforcement Report](https://dsm-document-archive.netlify.app/assets/doc-archive/code_enforcement_report_04-21-22.pdf)
    - As with the Work Session up til now, Mayor Cownie is absent. This is odd because it was Cownie who announced this way happening (seemingly under his discretion).
    - Consultant tasked with some form of "providing recommendations on how to get data on racial disparities in enforcement by the city" rather than anything related to solving disparities
    - Consultant looking at "best practices" from other police departments, which themselves are racist and violent
    - I'm a bit confused at what the ostensible "point" of this all is... seems like a task force to kick the can down the road
    - People were "surveyed" about racism in DMPD. This is odd because the racism in DMPD is not a matter of opinion, it is a known issue that is a fundamental problem regardless of people's opinions
    - Some recommendations around taking "community input", which is odd because the city has fought against community input vigorously since at least 2020.
    - In "comparable cities", Lincoln, NE is one of the main ones they relied upon
    - Lots of input from community on what data should be recorded, but a core problem here is that data recorded by the police will be unreliable
    - Actual decent conversation around data collection between the presenters, Gatto, Sheumaker, Mandelbaum, and Sanders
    - Gatto says he wants to "partner with the state", concerning
        - Gatto is upset that people who attend council meetings aren't pushing for a specific policing bill at the statehouse
    - Data Unit may need to be within DMPD due to privacy concerns
    - Public Works, LLC found that "The DMPD does not have a strategic plan with goals, objectives, and benchmarks." 
        - that means their strategic plan isn't public and is guided primarily by DMPD Chief Wingert's personal strategy with his own goals.
    - Public Works, LLC specifically brings up COMPSTAT as a guiding light. Talking about policing "cost effectively".
    - Public Works, LLC did not look into "encroachment cleanups" within neighborhood services
    - Mandelbaum calls for an implementation discussion by June. Sanders says June is not possible, and its not something to "rush".

    - Presented by DMPD [Youth Services](https://www.dsm.city/departments/police-division/operations/youth_services_coordinator.php) Coordinator SPO Deborah VanVelzen
        - prior SRO & public school teacher
    - involves "safety city"
    - involves "police athletic league" non-profit
    - Westergaard and others seem to want to superfund this program
    - lots of talk about "diversion" programs for youth
    - talk about marijuana as an addiction charge, then as a "gateway" issue
    - discussion around marijuana's elevated status gets escalated, Chief Wingert interjects the presenter and council saying he is against council having that discussion stating it may offend polk county
        - may revisit in January (with potentially new county attorney)
        - [more discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uts9cq3ZiBY&t=21537s)
    - Sheumaker asks about potential for diversion with non-youth, there seems to be possibility for some level of this
    - Chief Wingert claims there is bipartisan support at the statehouse to make marijuana a misdeameanor, which doesn't ring true
    - When Sheumaker asks about possible avenues for treating some of these crimes less seriously, and whether barriers exist at the state level, Wingert seems to admit the barrier isn't the statehouse and says "it wouldn't be allowed by me"
        - [clip](https://youtu.be/Uts9cq3ZiBY?t=21537)
        - He wants to push the buck to state or county attorney
        - He also refuses to "fly the flag" for that push
    - Mandelbaum has interest in the City working to build support across the state on marijuana law
    - Gatto openly talks about the City of Des Moines working with Davenport to push to punish bars with "public nuisance" enforcement [clip](https://youtu.be/Uts9cq3ZiBY?t=21835)
    - Westergaard speaks directly against strategizing around changing marijuana laws to cut off conversation, saying essentially "its not going to happen anyway, so we shouldn't try" [clip](https://youtu.be/Uts9cq3ZiBY?t=21915)
        - This is interesting because Westergaard (and others) have recently suggested that community members pushing the city on issues should instead push the state. If the state isn't going to act, what's the point?
        - This is also interesting because it goes directly against what Chief Wingert said moments earlier, since he explicitly said there was broad support for this at the statehouse
    - Gatto is very eager to spend city funds (including ARPA) on these police programs. Westergaard on board as well.
    - Voss wants to fund more bike programs with cops
    - DMPD did not come here with a fundraising pitch, but council was looking to throw money into this anyway.
- [Improve Our Neighborhoods](https://www.dsm.city/document_center/City%20Clerk/Work%20Sessions/2022/YouthProgramming_Presentation_Final.pdf?pdf=Des%20Moines%20Police%20Activities%20League%20and%202nd%20Chance%20Program&t=1651011288524)
    - Presented by SuAnn Donovan (Neighborhood Services Deputy Director)
    - Property Improvement Program rebranding as "DSM ION: Improving Our Neighbhorhoods"
    - SuAnn says this is "voluntarily" not enforced, but past conversations have contradicted that
    - Talk of bringing back enforcement piece [clip](https://youtu.be/Uts9cq3ZiBY?t=24632)
    - The City is already staffing the program
    - Note: ACLU (and others) have already taken issue with this [source](https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2021/08/20/des-moines-home-improvement-program-property-rights)
    - Sanders says that originally there was an enforcement piece, but that it went away. Says that they will need to bring it back in the future.
    - Council keeps wandering into diatribes about "helping people stay in their homes" etc, but that's not the point of this program. The point of this program is to raise property values by giving property owners more money and is explicitly targeted at groups like Seniors.
    - Odd that council members who frequently raise concerns around "property rights" are not bringing up concerns here.
- Council Board Updates
    - Gatto updates: Easter Lake Park improvement updates, Central Iowa Water Trails updates
    - Voss updates: Blank Park Zoo updates, Art Fest updates
