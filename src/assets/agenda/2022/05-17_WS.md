## Topics

- Police Community Engagement

## Overview

- This meeting happened SECOND (after Work Session)
- Mayor Cownie begins with an (unannounced) discussion about COVID, he lists off rising numbers, says the State is limiting what he can do, then declines to take the action he says he can (putting mask requirements on public city buildings)

## Notes

- No attachments provided (presentations, etc)
- City Manager begins the "police community engagement" topic by announcing that the City has consolidated multiple work sessions to this one, meaning the agenda provided to the public and work session requests by council members are not being followed

### Presentation One: Engaging with Contractor for Assistance with "Culture and Climate, Policies, Procedures, and Training" 

- Presented by DMPD Captain David Ness, Lt. Eric Hartman, and Chief Dana Wingert
- I believe Captain Ness is one of the cops who arrested someone in Council Chambers (while out of uniform)
- Real sloppy slideshow and presentation, presenter doesn't seem to have seem slides before
- Talking about "3rd Party Review" and "CALEA" Accredidation and Data Management
- Ness says that talks of "culture" work were not prompted by council action
- Ness says that CALEA grew out of the 60s and 70s "some of the early problems in our country" with Civil Disobedience and a perception that our law enforcement lacked "sound policies and procedures" pertaining to accountability, integrity, etc.
- "Commission for Law Enforcement Accreditation" created collaboratively in 1979 [here](https://www.calea.org/about-us)
    - International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP)
    - National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE)
    - National Sheriffs' Association (NSA)
    - Police Executive Research Forum (PERF)
- Seeking programs: "6th Edition Law Enforcement: 180 Standards - Basic LE1, 458 Standards - Advanced", "2nd Edition Communication: 207 Standards", "2nd Edition Training Academy: 160 Standards"
- "Promotes accountability... not with the Chief or Lieutenant..." (?)
- Some discussion between Councillor Boesen and Manager Sanders about the Review
    - Council Members refer to "small group" discussions about DMPD with City Manager Scott Sanders, which were not public

### Presentation Two: Community Review and Advisory Board Options
 
- Presented by City Manager Scott Sanders 
- Sanders wants to base direction on the existing "PPRC" (police review committee) and Public Works, LLC notes
- Too much discussion to write out
- Interesting back and forth where Councillor Westergaard asserts that with City Manager form of government Council is only responsible for Manager, Lawyer, and Clerk, and that Council is not responsible for the departments. Councillor Mandelbaum rebuts that its a policy direction to avoid engaging with accountability.

- Mayor Cownie tries to cut off the topic early before Councillor Boesen (who requested this topic) got a chance to speak
    - [clip](https://youtu.be/UleJZA3m-o0?t=5686)
- Vocal pushback from Westergaard and Gatto, most support from Mandelbaum, Sheumaker, and Boesen
- In conclusion, City Manager Sanders rebuts the councillors and pushing for limiting a potential board
    - Gatto says that we just need to "move on" from past DMPD violence, specifically referencing ongoing litigation
