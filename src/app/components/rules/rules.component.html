              <p>
                These rules were amended at a Regular Council Meeting on June 28, 2021 in agenda item 1-I.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Rule 37. Action on Consent Agenda" was amended as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If members of the public wish to request an item be pulled from the consent agenda, they
                  must send a request to the City Clerk by 3pm the day of the meeting (via email, mail, or other
                  writing).
                </li>
                <li>
                  No such oral requests may be made at the meeting.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These rules were put in place at the start of the meeting (around 5pm) and took effective immediately.
                That meant that
                at 5pm, council passed a requirement that anyone wishing to make a request must have made the request
                before 3pm,
                over 2 hours earlier.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vote passed unanimously and no public comment was permitted.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
